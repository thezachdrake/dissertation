Even the people passing the cart were asking about what the people were waiting for? Only to be surprised to know about the cart!\n\nComing over to the food, one can smell its aroma from a little distance and that's where the hunger kicks in, being a cart it definitely doesn't have any ambiance/atmosphere as such or can say the vibe is lively given the location they are based! The service is good and they try to deliver food quickly to you! The best part is they do accept card payment. Initially I had to ask them regarding this before waiting in the line as I didn't carry any cash!\n\nI ordered chicken over a saffron rice platter with fries and sauce on the side. The fries were crispy enough whereas the chicken was nicely marinated in spices and was really flavorful and tender, didn't expect it to be this tasty! The basmati rice was fluffy and moist enough with the right amount of saffron flavor in it whereas the pita bread was really soft but I didn't understand why they put it in the bottom of the platter, took a while to realize it was there! The white sauce was really good too, I don't think I have tasted a better white sauce than this whereas the red sauce was mildly spicy which I felt was the best at least according to my taste buds!\n\nOverall it was a great experience and I did understand why this place currently is on the top of halal cart pyramid than the Halal guys who share a rich legacy about the same in NYC!
