I wanted to correct wrinkles in order to create a youthful appearance -opposed to using filler.  Which in the past was a total nightmare for me! I had a great result and I will definitely be back for more treatments.  Also, We did one syringe for my lips. They look amazing and I haven’t been happier with the outcome. This Dr. truly knows how to place his Botox. I can’t say enough positive things. Just a complete thumbs up. If you want a doctor that truly cares, make an appointment to see Dr Papa. You won’t be disappointed! I will be sending my friends over. Thank you so much for making me feel my best!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I had an amazing experience at the Purefix MedSpa office with Dr Michael Abboud (AKA Dr Papa).
