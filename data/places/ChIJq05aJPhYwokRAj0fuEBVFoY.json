The room was not clean: there was trash still in the restroom bin from the previous guest, and the couch had a sticky, crusty, dripping stain all down the back. The worst part was the elevator. Absolutely RIDICULOUS that the front desk failed to inform me that anything was going on. I waited for my floor's elevator for 10 minutes before a maid told me I had to take the service elevator down. This created problems the remainder of my stay, with wait times for the service elevator up to 12 minutes. It was also extremely cramped to the point of being unsafe due to high demand. The \"waiters\" at happy hour and breakfast just sat around. Didn't attempt to be courteous, helpful, nothing. At breakfast, a sweet little boy asked an older \"waiter\" for something and he refused to answer, pointing at cabinets and making him search himself until the mom came over. Reception was terrible: they couldn't find the reservation of a repeat guest who shared his frustrations with me over their attitude. Of course, his reservation was found when they bothered to actually check. While they were dealing with him, the older woman at the desk literally talked on the phone to a family member for 7 minutes. Talking about Christmas, etc. It was extremely frustrating and inappropriate to have me wait. Finally, worst of all, the room to my door didn't close unless it was yanked shut. So I was completely unsafe and exposed until I noticed this. Then, while I was on a business call after returning from breakfast, a maid walked right into my room to tell me the door was open. I was clearly uncomfortable and she just kept talking and wouldn't leave the room- asking if I worked there for some reason. I explained multiple times I was a guest, thanks for calling out that the door was open. She just kept questioning me on if I was checking out, or if I was going to work. It was offensive and inappropriate: you specifically advertise within the room that no one will come in uninvited- what a joke! Finally, I got her out, but when I was leaving, she continued to question me in the hallway, seeing me with my luggage and stating accusingly \"I thought you were going to work\". I explained that I was, and that I was just taking my luggage with me, which shouldn't have been necessary.
