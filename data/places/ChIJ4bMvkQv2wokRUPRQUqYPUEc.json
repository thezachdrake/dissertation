I was expecting the Caribbean flavors and was let down and disappointed in my meal.  I even shared with my coworker for her opinion.   The best thing out of everything I ordered was the yams and lemonade.  The chicken was bland and had no flavor.  The peas and rice was okay.  The cabbage wasn’t cooked and still too crunchy again no seasoning/flavor.  The macaroni and cheese wasn’t good.  The cornbread was okay, it has pineapple in it.  I don’t think I’ll return and if I do it’ll only be for the yams and lemonade. This didn’t taste anything like Caribbean cuisine.  The portion of the food was also really small.
