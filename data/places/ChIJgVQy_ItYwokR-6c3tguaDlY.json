He proceeded to cut my hair as if he were trimming hedges after a multi-day coke binge. What I mean by this is: he snorted loudly to suck phlegm into the back of his throat from his sinuses every 30 seconds, left the building at one point to spit it onto the sidewalk, came back inside to blow his nose and keep cutting my hair without even washing his hands or using sanitizer. He raced through each step in the hair cutting process without paying attention to what he was doing, or how it looked after each step (I had to remind him to level my sideburns, for example), instead he chopped away, bumped his hands into my face accidentally, and pulled the comb THROUGH the knots in my hair, which hurt... In the end, once he dried my hair and reshaped it, I wasn't dissatisfied with what I saw in the mirror enough to risk being late to my interview. Once I got home after the interview, I showered, dried my hair slightly, got dressed and looked in the mirror to finish styling my hair and... WAIT.... did he give me a F****** BOWL CUT??

Hmm.... how is that possible? I clicked on the reviews tab, sorted by rating (high to low), and started reading. Almost immediately, I noticed that almost all of the 5 star reviews were from accounts which: use profile pictures that don't show a face or are otherwise generic stock images, have written at most 1 other review, and have made their reviews private so they're hidden from their profile page. I then noticed that these fake 5 star reviews are being written in batches, every several months (next to each review, Google tells you how long ago it was posted), and use nearly identical tone, vocabulary, and grammar in each. It isn't until you get down to the 1 star reviews that you start seeing reviews from Local Guides and accounts with real profile photos/public reviews.\n\nIt's unfortunate you've had to stoop this low for your business to survive, but don't worry.
