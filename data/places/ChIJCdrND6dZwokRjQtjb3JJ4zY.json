This was on 1/6/24 which was hella cold🥶, wet ☔and snowy❄️☃️ that day. This was the perfect spot to enjoy a nice warm bowl of yummy goodness!!! From the time you walk in you are greeted courteously and politely by the staff. Which is not the norm in A LOT of places!  I wanted a booth type of table but was told it's for a party of 3 or more but I later noticed as the place filled up, smaller parties like mine were seated at booths which kind of irritated me but nevertheless we were seated right away. I just wanted a more cozy setting for my bf and I celebrating his birthday and my pregnancy. Since I've been pregnant I haven't been able to eat a lot of things due to the ups and downs of the first trimester but I was ecstatic to see I was able to really enjoy each item I ordered. I ordered the Veggie Gyoza 🥟 and the Spicy Veggie Ramen 🍜 and my bf ordered the Shoyu Ramen 🍜 and a Nigori 🥛. Which my bf was ecstatic about because he said a lot of other ramen spots tend not to carry it. Our food came out in a timely fashion.  I really appreciate how attentive our waitress was. Always making sure our cups will refilled and looking around to see if we or anyone else needed anything. I hope I get her again when I go back! I must say the Veggie Gyoza was absolutely amazing. One of the best I've ever had. It was the perfect crispness on the outside and softness on the inside. The Spicy Veggie Ramen 🍜 was so delicious 🤤 mouth watering and flavorful. The broth, omg the broth... I've never had Ramen broth like that before. You could taste all the spices!!! The spiciness was perfect as well! Nothing needed to be added( I've been to other Ramen spots where I had to add pepper flakes and chilli oil to the broth to flavor it up). The noodles were the perfect chewiness( not an actual word I think but IDC, lol). Even the sauce they used for you to dip each tender Veggie Gyoza in was seasoned to perfection!!! My bf devoured his bowl and I can tell he really enjoyed it as well. I couldn't finish mine but I took the rest home bussed it down once I got in, lol...nomnomnommmmm. While you wait for your food to come they also bring you yummy authentic Green tea🍵. Which made up for us not getting the booth seating that I wanted, lol. Literally everything made up for it! The ambiance and the decor is very friendly, bright and warm. I loved the cool Anime-ish themed art work on the walls!!! I have raved about this place to my friends and definitely will be coming back real soon to try more items and the Japanese sodas!!! The pricing is nice for the food, not expensive once you add in tax, tip and CC fee. I would highly recommend coming here to have amazing food and to take it all in and enjoy the ambiance!!! Definitely also a great date idea place!!! 😁 I hope when I come back I have an even better experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"As part two of the birthday🎂 surprise 🎉 for my bf, I took him here!!!
