If you look past the front desk, you will see walls of cabinets filled with file folders that hold client records. It echoes my dentist’s office in 1992.

I didn’t even realize someone was sitting behind the front desk when we walked in because he didn’t bother greeting us since it’s clear he hates his job. My dog did NOT want to be in that office at all. She was getting the same bad vibes as me. She kept trying to leave and I should have followed her out the door instead of going through with the appointment and exam, which was a waste of time and money. The vet very clearly was shooting in the dark to diagnose my dog, who was having excess vaginal discharge. He was trying to convince me that my dog is incontinent (she was discharging clear vaginal fluid, not urine) and that she has a heart murmur (all of the vets we’ve seen prior and the vet we have seen subsequently have said my dog does NOT have a heart murmur). I don’t know how this guy has such a loyal client base with rave reviews on here when his service and methods seem to be operating within a 1990s time capsule. Go here if you don’t think modern instruments, technology, and record management systems are needed to help care for your dog. I have since gone to a vet that more closely matches my expectations and my usual experience with a professional vet."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I don’t understand how this place operates without a computer.
