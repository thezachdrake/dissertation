My friend and I both have a low risk tolerance when it comes to covid for personal health reasons, so we were a little taken aback when we arrived and saw someone cleaning our room without a mask just prior to our appointment. My friend wasn’t comfortable with this, so I politely asked the front desk staff if there was another clean private spa that hadn’t just had an unmasked person in it. They graciously accommodated our request, which I greatly appreciated and allowed us to have a more relaxing experience. The spa was clean and complete with nice details to create a luxurious environment. This is a good option for spa lovers who aren’t ready to unmask and sweat it out with strangers quite yet. Just be aware that S10 doesn’t check vaccination status or require staff or other guests to wear masks. Although that aspect was a little disappointing, it actually made their willingness to accommodate our hesitation more meaningful."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My friend and I booked a 60 minute private spa session last week.
