I was searching for a black-owned nail salon here in the Bronx and I came upon Le Nailtique Noire. It had awesome reviews and from the pictures available it looked like a great place. I got two hard gel manicures here and I was left disappointed. About three weeks had passed from my first appointment, to my last appointment (today), and my nails were in rough shape. On about 6 fingers, the hard gel was lifting, and on the right thumb the gel was almost off. Instead of filing off those areas that have lifted and reapplying the hard gel polish to the exposed nail, the nail tech poorly applied super glue to the perimeter of the outgrown gel. Not only was this ineffective, it is dangerous because it traps the water, moisture, and bacteria that has managed to get into the pocket between the gel polish and the nail, and can lead to serious nail infections. Needless to say, using superglue was a cheap \"alternative\" to properly fixing any lifting nails. In all my years of getting my nails done, I have never and I mean NEVER had a nail tech do something as lazy as this. Additionally communication was very poor on her end. When she filed my nails she did not ask me if I was okay with the shape, or the length. When I requested a forrest green polish, I was NOT given an option of greens to choose from. Instead she chose a Kelly green, which is pretty, but not what I asked for. To top it off, she forgot to apply topcoat to my right thumb, which was left looking matte and unfinished. It goes without saying that I was very disappointed with this manicure and will not be returning. When a nail tech cannot be bothered to properly fix a lifting nail, it is usually a sign to run. On my way home, I made an appointment with another nail salon to fix this poorly done manicure. Attached to this review are pictures that I took immediately after the appointment. The white patches on my nails are the areas where the gel has lifted from my nail."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I hate that I have to write this review, but nonetheless I feel as though it is important for me to share my experience.
