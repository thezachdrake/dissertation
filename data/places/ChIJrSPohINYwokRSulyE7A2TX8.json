(We moved from NJ to CA.) (tldr: lack of communication, damaged boxes and furniture upon arrival, poor quality of service)\n\nIn the beginning, Jeff was very attentive and made us feel like “Yes! This is the quality of service we’re looking for in a company!” and the quoted price was great. He told us everything we needed to know about our move and we were excited to move forward. (Disclaimer: Low price is because they have other moves on the same truck as yours. We figured it wouldn’t be a problem... it was.) But once we had our stuff loaded on to the truck, that’s when it went all downhill.\n\nFirst things first, the pick-up movers told us how much we should be tipping them (they said they wanted 20%), which was extremely unprofessional. I don’t mind if they had just mentioned that tips are appreciated, but to have the balls to flat out tell me you want 20%? Really?\n\nI didn’t hear from Jeff for about a week after our initial pick-up, and when he did respond, all he could tell me was that our stuff was still waiting to be put onto the truck and our 6 day delivery window remained the same. He told me he would update with information when he had some. I asked him if it was possible to get a tighter delivery window once the truck was in transit and he informed me that once we got closer to the delivery window he’d have a better estimate of when our stuff should be arriving. (At this point, we were 9 days from the first day of our delivery window and 7 days since pick-up.)\n\nAnother we goes by without any correspondence from Jeff. I’m starting to get a little anxious because it’s 2 days from the first day of our delivery window and we have no idea where our stuff is. So I contact him again asking if he had an update. The first day of the delivery window is pushed back a day. Still very vague. I ask again if he could provided a tighter delivery window since were working people and need to make arrangements to receive this move if it does come on a work day. He said he’ll try his best.\n\nSo now it’s the first day of the delivery window! Hurray! But silence on Jeff’s end. At this point, we figured he’d have some sort of idea where the truck is and have an idea of when the truck should be arriving to us. I email Jeff and no response. I get that it’s a Saturday, but if client is paying thousands of dollars to use your services, just a quick acknowledgement would be appreciated.\n\nWe get a call later that day from the driver saying he’s in the area and will delivery the following day or the next, depending on the other deliveries. Okay, great! But why wasn’t Jeff able to provide that information to us? The driver told us that they’re not actually a part of Movage and they’re hired to do jobs within Movage (which was one of the first questions I asked because I wanted to make sure that the move wasn’t being contracted out to third parties 😒), so the drivers themselves weren’t even in touch with Movage at all.\n\nAnd then our stuff finally arrives... boxes were damaged, wet, opened, our couch was soaked on one side... I’ll let the pictures do the talking.\n\nThe response we get after we express our extreme disappointment is just a very textbook: “I apologize for any inconvenience. This is not the typical feed back we receive from our customers. I will help you as much as possible as I have tried to do from the first time we spoke. I will attach a claims form to this email. Please fill it out at your earliest convenience so we can start a claim process for you. Thank you.”\n\nIf you’re looking to do a long distance move, go with Mayflower. We deeply regret not choosing to go with them in the first place."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I can’t believe I have to write this review, but I figured it was fair to warn everyone who’s looking to use Movage for a long distance move.
