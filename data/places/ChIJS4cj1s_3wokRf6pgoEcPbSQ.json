Slav has a different approach that allows for his specialized training while going at your own pace.  This doesn't mean that he will let you slack off.  It's quite the opposite!  There have been many days where I would like to wrap it up, but he will have me stay an extra 15-20 minutes to make sure I have completed the full body workout.  Also, you can't beat the prices, especially in this neighborhood!
