My mother, a real estate professional whose license was associated with Regis, was instrumental in facilitating a deal that should have resulted in a commission for her efforts. Sadly, she passed away before the transaction was completed.\n\nDespite the clear expectation and ethical obligation for Regis to honor the agreed-upon commission to my mother’s estate, he failed to do so. Instead of addressing the situation with the professionalism and integrity expected in such circumstances, Regis chose to mislead both my mother's estate and our family friend involved in the purchase. He inaccurately claimed that he could not pay the commission to my mother's estate due to her passing, a statement contradicted by the legal provision for estates to receive owed earnings.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation, when attempts were made to resolve this matter amicably and ensure my mother's estate received the commission rightfully owed, Regis ignored all communications. Upon insisting on the estate's rights, he proceeded to block any further contact, effectively shutting down dialogue immediately after the deal's closure.\n\nThis experience was not only distressing due to the financial implications but also because of the manner in which Regis conducted himself throughout the process. Reports of his behavior towards clients have been troubling, including verbal insults and a generally intimidating and bullying demeanor. It is regrettable to have to share such a negative account, but it is crucial for potential clients to be aware of these serious professional shortcomings.\n\nThe loss of my mother was difficult enough without the added stress and disappointment of dealing with such unprofessionalism. I had hoped for a resolution that reflected the hard work my mother put into this deal and honored her memory appropriately. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I advise caution if considering Regis Roumila for real estate services, based on this personal experience of unethical behavior and lack of professional integrity."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am writing this review after a deeply disappointing experience with Regis Roumila, a broker who was involved in a real estate transaction following the introduction by my late mother.
