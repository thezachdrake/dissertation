My daughter and I attended the Spring Walk to Workshop as a special travel experience during our vacation in NYC.  We had a wonderful time making lasting memories. It was an amazing opportunity to experience the New York flower market in Chelsea with the fabulously-talented owner of Flower Girl, Denise Porcaro Tupper, and her delightful staff. We met in the flower district on a beautiful Spring morning. We saw such a gorgeous array of beautiful plants and flowers. It was a great time for experiencing Spring flowers; lilacs, tulips, peonies,hydrangeas, roses, wisteria were in abundance. We saw gorgeous tropical foliage, orchids, succulents and great big branches for creating spectacular and ethereal floral designs. We visited a huge showroom of dried flowers in every color imaginable.\nDenise helped us pick out 8-10 types of flowers and greenery to make a fabulous combination of colors and texture. I’ve never seen such such gorgeous and fresh flowers. We chose Ranunculous,Sweet Pea, Anenome, Lilac, Lisianthus, spray roses, Astranthia, Waxflower and Seeded Eucalyptus. Denise was incredibly generous with her time and insights about her career and business which was so wonderful for my daughter who is just getting started in the industry. Denise is such a wonderful role model of creativity and success. We strolled a few blocks to the Flower Girl shop where we had a lovely array of fruit and pastries and coffee. Denise gave us a primer on prepping our flowers and shared her design philosophy in creating an arrangement. She also gave us practical info about caring for our arrangements for a longer  vase life. We received an adorable Flower Girl tote bag with goodies including a fab smelling signature Flower Girl candle,a note pad, and a pair of vintage style scissors. A professional photographer took pictures of us with our arrangements so we have a lasting record of them.  We left the shop and delivered our arrangements to a friend of my daughter who lives in the city since we were getting on a plane the next day. She was surprised and delighted!\nI highly recommend taking a Flower Girl workshop.
