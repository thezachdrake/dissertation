Theresa took care of everything that's needed for my mom to have a decent and solemn funeral. I think the last thing you need to worry about when someone you love passed away was having to arrange for the funeral. You can't think straight specially when you are grieving. I can't believe how inexpensive was her service compared to all the other companies that I spoke to before her(located in NYC and in NJ). From the moment I talked to her on the phone I can feel her compassion and concern. She told me how much it's going to cost (which is a quarter of the cheapest quote that I got from another company) and sent me all the paper works that we need to sign and submit. Actually I was a bit hesitant at first as we just talked over the phone and didn't meet her until the day of the cremation, yes she was there on the day of the cremation at Greenwood Crematory in NJ to make sure everything will go well and my mom and everyone is taken cared of. I would also like to mention that My mom was wearing her ring when she passed away in the hospital and we asked if we can get the ring and she arranged it with the hospital and gave us the ring when we met her at the chapel. The cremation was scheduled at 12 noon but she gave us more than enough time to bid my mom goodbye one last time in a beautiful chapel. We didn't feel rushed as she was willing to wait for other guests who came in a little late. She was very respectful and compassionate all the way. We can't really thank her enough. She is indeed a blessing. Thank you so much Theresa. God bless you more."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My mom passed away last February 2020.

She gets an A+ for always getting back to me and answering any questions.\nWhen I returned to Virginia, she handled everything and even overnighted the death certificates I requested.
