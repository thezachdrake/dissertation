He resurfaced for one day (following the original review), did not resolve or even seem to understand my issue, but did manage to tell me that there were about $300 worth of old utilities bills they \"forgot\" to charge me that are now due.

But Michael Francisco, Director of Operations, is incredibly frustrating to work with. He ignores emails on a consistent basis and does not solve issues.\n\nMY ADVICE: if you are going to rent from Carlyle, keep a very close eye on your bills. They will send you erroneous bills and will not properly document other charges. Then they will ignore your emails and it will take months to fix things.\n\nApartment issues so far have included:\n- mice;\n- water damage on the ceiling and in the bathroom - I first reported the ceiling damage over a year ago, it is still not fixed. I reported the bathroom water damage in April or May and they painted over it but still have not addressed the actual damage.\n- Otherwise, the apartment itself has served me well.\n.\nManagement issues:\n- I have received 10+ erroneous water/sewage bills in the mail despite my lease stating that I pay a set fee monthly for this; I've never missed a payment. It took multiple emails to Michael Francisco (many of which went fully ignored) for him to address this and I am still receiving erroneous bills in the mail. When he did respond, he had not read my emails fully and he questioned my ability to read whether the bill was for electricity or water/sewage.\n\n- I have never received an actual bill for my utilities charges - just a random charge added spontaneously to my online account. They bill anywhere from 2-8 months late, sometimes adding multiple months at once, so it is impossible to monitor your usage. On May 4, 2019, I asked for a ledger outlining my usage and explaining the charges. I have sent 40+ emails back and forth and Michael ignored the high majority of them. It was not until I reached out to Melissa that my requests were even acknowledged. I am continuously told that I will receive something \"today or tomorrow morning.\" However it has been almost 4 months and I have no explanation or documentation of the veracity of my utilities charges (as of 07/23/2019).\n\n- I am subletting my apartment for the summer. It took weeks for my tenant's application to be reviewed despite ongoing follow-up on my part. They also refused to waive the credit check portion of the application despite the fact that legally my tenant is not financially liable to Carlyle, only me. The owners refused to work with me on that one and then delayed the processing of his application for over a month. Once again, nothing happened until Melissa became involved (again, I would give her five stars if possible).\n\nEDIT (since I cannot reply to the owner's response): I will not be taking additional time to reach out to your general corporate phone number. As stated, I have a 40+ email chain that Michael Francisco has yet to acknowledge or answer. Please feel free to reach out to me directly to resolve the issues.
