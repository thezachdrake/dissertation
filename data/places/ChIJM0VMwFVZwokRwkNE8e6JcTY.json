I did visit on a Tuesday night so staffing wasn't at it's highest and so wait time to be served was a bit longer than expected.  The drink prices will drive your check up, expect to pay $20 for a neat cognac and $20 for a gin and tonic, top shelf.  Overall the food was tasty and the drinks Frank made were delish.\n\nBest of luck with the new opening!"},"publishTime":"2023-11-29T18:29:20Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJM0VMwFVZwokRwkNE8e6JcTY/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0OTllYi1nRRAB","rating":5,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLFD35ISX5T2O7nuwDMuFph0tlcznIufPbVl6NL_M_r=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117851915859999142372/reviews","displayName":"Neki Doshi"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was last minute looking for a spot to celebrate my birthday..
