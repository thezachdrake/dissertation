My first Movie I've seen with AMC was Argylle. the staff was friendly. one thing happened that was weird. 15 minutes before the movie and trailers started the screen was white and it had an error message but they were on it fast and fixed it. I don't know if this was a known issue but to me it felt weird because I never experienced this with Regal. The screen was much bigger than the regal one I visited before. At least I felt it was big I don't know and the auditorium I was in didn't have recliners but the seats was comfortable. the seats was too close to each other so my legs was cramping up.\n\nThe popcorn tasted better than the one I had at regal and I also bought the coke zero vanilla which was delicious and I never tasted that before. I was originally supposed to go to the kipsy bay at 31st Street which was closer but the movie showing was at 12:20 I believe and since it was raining I didn't want to wait around. One of the reasons why I love regal because they have early showings. I was looking for the mean girls popcorn bucket which I was told they didn't have so I ended up buying the dune popcorn bucket which I was surprised because the movie didn't come out yet. My advice is if you are looking for the collectable buckets go into the theater because you might order it online for pickup and they might not have any. Overall my experience was great and fun. I highly recommend this place."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I've been going to Regal since the summer of 2023.
