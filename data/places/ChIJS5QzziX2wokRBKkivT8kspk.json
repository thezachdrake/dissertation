My companion ordered a margarita, which was likewise very tasty. House chips and salsa were fresh and fantastic. For my entree, I got Chilaquiles con Huevo y Pollo, and it was excellent. Tasty salsa verde, fresh tortillas, tender and nicely crisped chicken, queso fresco, and crema. Egg yolk was over, but I can't get too mad haha. My +1 got huevos divorciados, the classic dueling red and green sauces over poached eggs, frijoles negros, and jamon. The bartender was really friendly and helpful, and though we only had one alcoholic drink each with our meal, he kept our water glasses full throughout our meal, and conversed with us pleasantly.
