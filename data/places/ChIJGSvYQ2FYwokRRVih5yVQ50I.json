Long story short…the process of expanding her jaw and palate and then straightening her teeth took many years and was an involved process with Dr. Matthew doing an amazing job as well as preparing my daughter for the different stages so she could take the steps he needed her to on a daily basis.

Today, seven years down the line at age 14, she has a beautiful set of teeth and is in the last stages of her treatment where she uses a retainer every night to ensure that her teeth stay in place.
