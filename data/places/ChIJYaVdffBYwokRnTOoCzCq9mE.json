This is very different from places like the ritz there they take the time to get to know you and engage in meaningful ways to make the stay a memorable one.\n\nOur suite includes some sort of a white glove butler service but I’ve not even see the butler once during my stay.

It’s also quite unique in the sense that it’s in a historic building in the sea of ultra modern high rises.   However, the hotel seems to only occupy the south wing and is quite small despite looking imposing from the outside. As a result most of the rooms don’t have much of a view to speak of.
