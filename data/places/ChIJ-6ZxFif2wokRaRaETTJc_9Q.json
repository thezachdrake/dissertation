My roommates and I went shopping together, but rung up separately @ self check out.

For some reason, this irked one of the employees working here. After aggressively yelling at me to come back to the register (despite it not being my items & I had already paid) he accused me of stealing. He took my receipt and crumpled it up. Explaining the situation and showing him my receipt along with 1 item I had purchased was not effective in calming him down. My roommate came over asking him to just void or cancel the transaction because it was having problems, but he insisted she had to pay the higher total. Since she had finished at another register already, she said she would not. Before we knew it, he was yelling at his boss about us. Then, we were told to go to customer service. Of course, my lack of receipt only caused more problems. When I asked the register attendant if he would give me my receipt back, he ignored me. While we were happy to display that we did not steal, we were disappointed in the employees for not listening to us when we were explaining what actually happened. No proof was enough. It was belittling. They re-rung up all our items only to find we never stole. Very disappointed with this customer service, the worst I have ever had at a Whole Foods.
