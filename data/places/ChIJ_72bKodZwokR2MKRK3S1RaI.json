They did not care at all. And I wasn't taking my sweet time getting dressed or moving any slower than these people, they would just spend more time on others. Like it took more time for my hair and makeup lady to curl this woman's entire head of hair than it took for her to just pin mine up. The lady that did my hair and makeup was rude and I absolutely HATED the way she did my makeup. I looked like James Charles. If that's your style that's fine but personally- I don't want to look like a caked up mess with uneven lipstick and bushy eyebrows. The makeup wasn't even the only problem, I also HATED the way she did my hair. For every single outfit. I would have looked better if I did my own hair and makeup and went in like that. I spent half- if not MOST of the time just sitting on the couch waiting for her to finish hair or makeup on a different person, and she would do normal things for them! Like just curling that one woman's hair. I spent about 10 minutes in the bathroom after the last shoot just scrubbing the makeup off my face and soaking the product out of my hair because I was genuinely embarrassed. I looked so bad. Only posting the pictures with the review so you can see what I am talking about. My friends and family will hopefully never see these. When I was finally able to go view my images the woman was extremely pushy with buying but I get that, it's a business. They're just trying to make money so I understand that, but to a certain extent! We had also told her also that we were in a rush to get home and she did not care and continued off topic conversation about the Kardashians, J-Lo, Scarlet Johansson and all these actresses that started off small. I only liked 3-4 images out of the 40 that she had of me and when I asked if I could buy 2-4 she asked me why I would ever just buy 2 or 4. I said because those are the only ones I liked and she went on to say how we are the hardest critics on ourselves. No... the pictures were just genuinely bad. I also asked her if I would be refunded my deposit and she didn't even want to give me a refund when it is promised that as long as you show up to the shoot, you will be refunded the deposit. She never refunded me. She said she will keep the money and it will go towards if I change my mind and decide to buy any pictures. I said I didn't want to buy any and she kept insisting on doing a payment plan for the biggest package possible, talking about credit cards and paying 400 today but we wouldn't be given any of the images until it was paid in full (attached an image of their pricing too!) Total waste of time and money as well to even get to the studio. The only kind person the entire time I was there was the photographer, I'm not sure of her name but she was a young asian woman. She was sweet and made small talk by asking where i was from. All my hair and makeup lady talked about was the Kardashians, and she cursed a lot during the whole thing. I am not one to ever post reviews but I wanted to share my experience so people know what's up. Thank you for reading this far, that's my review. MAPS give me my deposit back.
