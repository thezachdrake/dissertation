We came across a vinyl fence with a cement curb under it that my wife and I were looking to do at our home.  It had their company name on it.  After researching them, and other companies, on the internet we decided to give Scullari a call.  We set up a meeting with Anthony Scullari.  Anthony is an experienced and knowledgeable man who has great, practical, ideas and is easy to talk to.  His company doesn’t just do vinyl fences, but just about anything you need done:  Vinyl fence with cub, sidewalk cement, driveway, additions, stonework, entrance door and widening of the entrance, front of the house and porch, back of the house deck and yard, siding for all around the house, remodeling of the inside of the house, etc.  We hired him to do our vinyl fence with cement curb underneath all around the house; wrap and siding for the house; and remodel of our front porch with widening of our basement and stoop steps, lengthening of our porch overhang and finished it with natural stonework.  Anthony’s Scullari team of Sal and the guys were very professional, clean, thorough, quiet and organized.  I had neighbors come over to look at their work up close stating what a great job they were doing.  They also added how amazed they were that they didn’t hear them much, but they did noticed how they worked hard all day.  At the end of each day they would end by cleaning up and organizing their materials before they left.  Construction work is a scary endeavor, but A&S Scullari Construction Corp. left my wife and I with a sense of peace about the work they were doing:  professional, clean, orderly and respectful!  Thank you Anthony, Sal and all the A&S Scullari Construction Corp. team who we now consider like family."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"A&S Scullari Construction Corp. is an amazing company.
