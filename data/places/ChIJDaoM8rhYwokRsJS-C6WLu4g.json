Here is a quote from a letter from my insurance provider responding to my appeal:\n“Your file was presented to the Clinical Complaint Committee for review. This committee includes a licensed general dentist and various other insurance personnel. Dental records, considered a legal document, were reviewed. The records do not reflect evidence of osseointegration, and the implant should not have been loaded until the osseointegration was completed. In addition, the design and outcome of the abutment and crown are not appropriate due to poor marginal integrity. Records further reflect residual cement was left, which promoted additional localized inflammation.”\nIn other words, unprofessionalism and negligence on each step of the procedure unsurprisingly led to the implant failure.\nSummary:\nIf you have extra teeth, nerves and money…use Dr. Marina Gendel’s services!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do you call a dentist who doesn’t know how to perform implants properly, but attempts them anyway? What do you call a dentist who cuts corners when a complex surgery is involved? What do you call a dentist who pockets your money and denies any responsibility for the damage she caused? Now I know to call her Dr. Gendel.\nI made the mistake of coming to her for an implant, which cost me a great deal of pain, time, and money. I did not question her judgement when she said she could install it without a bone graft. (Only later she admitted she cannot perform a bone graft). I did not think twice about signing a standard consent form acknowledging potential risks of treatment (partly because I was already in the chair with one cheek going numb when she shoved this paper in my hand). I did not suspect that this consent form will be her “catch-all” cover for negligence and incompetence.\nA few weeks after Dr. Gendel finished her work, I had a failed implant and an infection. In despair, I sought advice from other dentists, which made me realize that she skipped some critical steps (x-rays, CT scan, cleaning, follow ups, and possibly more). When I reached out to her office, she told me to “wait for the implant to fall out” and tried to treat the infection with antibiotics. Her story about my diagnosis and remediation kept changing each time things didn’t magically heal on their own. Feeling scared, overwhelmed and hoping for some professional integrity, I asked her to refund me the cost of treatment so I could use the money towards remediation…  How did Dr. Gendel respond? No empathy, no show of concern, no offer to help… she said that she’s keeping all the payments and that I signed the consent form, which somehow means SHE TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Just want to follow up on my previous review about poor work done by Dr. Marina Gendel on my implant.
