The greek salad was fresh and nicely seasoned.   For dinner we had the whole fish, Tsipoura, which was like a sea breem, grilled to perfection.  We had a bunch of the Fig spritz drinks which were strong and tasty.  Overall, the food and drinks were very good.\nThe service left something to be desired as it took a while to get the waiters to get back to us for additional drinks.  At one point, we got up and went to the second bar in the back for additional drinks; our easier finally came back to us with the bill.\nThere is entertainment in the form of belly dancers and sparklers every 30-45 minutes which makes for a fun time to take out visitors who want some dinner entertainment.   The bar in the back has a DJ and feels like a small club after dinner, which was also fun.\nGreat food, fun ambiance, but needs more on the service side.
