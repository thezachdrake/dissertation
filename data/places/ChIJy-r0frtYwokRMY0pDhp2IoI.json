She also did a great jobbing pairing Joseph with my daughter for her sessions. He truly makes the time together fun and in just a few short weeks we saw progress. He continues to push her during their time together, but also does a great job of understanding what interests her to plan sessions around those interest to ensure she is fully engaged while also working with her to explore new things.
