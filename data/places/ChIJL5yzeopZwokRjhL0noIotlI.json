He said he would be there to talk about the issue along with the master tailor, but on our scheduled date, Desmond didn't show up. The Master Tailor said he ONLY spoke Spanish and none of the other employees in the store spoke Spanish so no one could help me communicate with the tailor. I tried to use my very rusty and broken Spanish, but had super low confidence in the job because the Tailor had such a condescending \"what's your problem? we can fix it?\" attitude the whole time and refused to acknowledge the issue.
