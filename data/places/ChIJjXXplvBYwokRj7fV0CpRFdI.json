The attendant parking my car even tried to HIDE the damage by popping my tail late back into my car. Upon retrieval of my car, it was backed up against the concrete wall with the rear passenger facing the concrete wall on both sides DELIBERATELY HIDING the damage they caused to my car. It was not until I was home that I noticed the tail light had popped out and upon closer inspection noted the damage. Of note, a call was placed to their garage at 8:48 PM asking for the name of the parking attendant, security footage, supervisor information, and insurance information to which they REFUSED to provide me with this.

The parking attendant working, Walter, had no idea what “form” we were referring to and said we should come back when his supervisor was available, again giving us the run around and not providing any names.\n\nI then called at 9:48 am and spoke with Walter and advised him that the company has a legal obligation to provide their insurance information whenever a worker is at fault for damage to a customer’s vehicle. It was at this time that Walter confirmed there were 2 attendants working the night of 8/14/23: BERNIE C. and MOHAMMED A.
