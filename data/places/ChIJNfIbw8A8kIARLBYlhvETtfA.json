The food is legit restaurant quality for cheaper.\n\nI checked, and I literally have 51 meal options this week, so clearly they have a large variety of choices. Their options are diverse and more creative than just pork + veggie. They have very healthy options & comfort food options, as well as dishes that are both. They have unqiue foreign dishes as well as well-known homey dishes. I especially recommend their Chicken Chilaquiles Verde, it tasted AMAZING and was ultra easy to make.\n\nNo problems except 2 small missing items which they refunded me for immediately as credit, no hassle. The recipes are easy & fun to make.\n\nOverall I'm super happy with Dinnerly and I would recommend them to anyone who wants to learn to cook delicious healthy meals. I can get 3 meals of 4 servings for around $80. Think about it, thats a pretty good price for restaurant quality food, plus I sometimes have leftovers & I'm learning all these great recipes at the same time.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is they don't have recipe cards, but I think they may offer cards as an option soon."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dinnerly is my favorite meal kit & what I've chosen to stick with.
