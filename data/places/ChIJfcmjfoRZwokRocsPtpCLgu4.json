Years later, when Covid happened, she gave me another reading and said that she sees a vast land in a foreign country and I am there in a farm but I live in a big city, and I am just there for a visit, but the land belongs to my family. At that time, I was in LA, I do not own any land. So, I took it as a metaphor. However my husband's family in Sicily are land owners. Soon after Covid hit hard in the US, my husband and I decided to go to Sicily to stay with my mother in law. Her reading came true. I was in a field picking peppers, lettuces, tomatoes.  I never thought an aura reading is a prediction of the future. Perhaps, my aura told Kumi my future and she translated it and related the message to me. The thought of Sicily never came to my mind, but the circumstances had directed me to that direction.
