I didn't mind the location, which is a little run down with homeless people about, but that doesn't bother me and you could get around mid Manhattan easily with a short walk which was great. The traffic noise was bad in the morning and it has an overpass right next to the building so I would suggest if you stay here to get a room on an upper floor if you want to sleep in. The staff were nice but what really annoyed me was when I was leaving I asked them to book me a cab to the airport, which they did but it was a \"private car\" in a pretty bad state at almost twice the price of the fixed airport rate for cabs. I can only assume they did this for a kick back.
