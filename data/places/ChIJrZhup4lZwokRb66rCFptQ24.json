As someone who moved to the US fairly recently, I was forced by the building I was renting from (Magnolia Dumbo) to use the Guarantors even though I met the rental requirements with my income and my sister and her husband were also more than willing to act as my guarantors to prove I was good for the rent. All this because I did not have US history, despite showing them my perfect UK credit score of 999/999. I’ve now built\nup enough credit history to not need to use the guarantors anymore (thank God). I recently moved out of Magnolia Dumbo, and I got an email from the Guarantors l, stating that I was in lease default and needed to pay back some money which they had paid to my previous landlord. I was shocked, as I was not informed there was any lease default, and I was, in fact, told that I was in good standing upon inspection of the apartment when I moved out. I contacted the guarantors, who then explained that it was actually my final electricity bill paid on my behalf, and I would need to reimburse them. Since then, I have been trying to contact the Guarantors, to understand why I still need to make a reimbursement, despite the fact that I paid nearly one month rent to them, which I was told would be non-refundable, and would act as a security deposit replacement for my building. So far, the only thing that the Guarantors have managed to guarantee me is utter frustration. This feels like a total rip off and legitimized scam, and I am shocked that this type of service is allowed. They claim that they are taking on the risk of taking me on as a tenant, because I have no credit history, But there were other ways in which they could have proved my credit worthiness. I can only assume that New York rental buildings and the guarantors are in collusion to make money off people like me who have no choice but to pay this money because we need a place to live when we move to the US.  I am so glad I will hopefully never have to use this company again. I truly do feel sorry for foreigners like me who move to the US and have to deal with a company like this."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"It is truly surprising to me how this company seemingly has all these great reviews on Google!
