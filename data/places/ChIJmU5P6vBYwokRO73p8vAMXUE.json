At times, the wait for hotels could really be frustrating. Not in this hotel.\nDining: I tried the breakfast at the 46th floor roof top Darling bar. The views are magnificent and the service was great. Food quality is average but the staff put extra efforts to make you enjoy your food and drinks\nThe room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. One improvement needed would be upgrading the blackouts curtains to be auto operated instead of manually\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my stay and this will definitely be my place of choice for future visits to NYC"},"publishTime":"2023-11-02T16:09:50Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJmU5P6vBYwokRO73p8vAMXUE/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWdDQ3Vl93RRAB","rating":5,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwuv4P7OCDM_SI4IfLHDKvr1WHxLYm5tTvB_qGJ08niA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108154408646990327136/reviews","displayName":"Jeremy McNeely"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Great place to stay.
