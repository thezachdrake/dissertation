I never review but feel this place is so bad it is my duty to let you know.\n\nOver the last 2 months, I've spent $300+ at this store. WHY? While the PRICES ARE VERY HIGH, it is on my way home and was convenient.\n\nMy first purchase was an e-cigerette vaporizer pen called the \"ego one vape pen\" for $89 (retails for $39 online). I also bought $20 of e-juice. During this purchase, I was told not to buy the discount pens because if they don't work I can't return it. Ok, I'll take your word.

I've been out of town on business and haven't been able to return it.\n\nToday, 14-days later, I went back to simply exchange the clearly DEFECTIVE unit. They first tried to blame the issue on me. After another customer confirmed he has had the same issue with the same product, they then said they only accept returns after 7-days. WHAT? They then were very rude and insisted nothing could be done... Great way to run a business.\n\nIn all, I calculate I've spent $310 in 2 months. I should have bought everything online and saved $115.
