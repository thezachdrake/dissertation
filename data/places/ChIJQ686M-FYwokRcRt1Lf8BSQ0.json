I did 3 privates with Katie before entering the group class. The privates IMO helped me transition into the group classes much smoother as I was someone who previously never did reformer pilates before. So, if possible, I'd recommend at least one private before group classes just to learn the feeling and have someone be able to correct your form individually.\n\nI have been going 4-5 times per week. I've had four separate instructors and I will say that each instructor has a distinct style. They do not do the same kind of class. I like this for the amount that I go because I know an instructor like Blair will kick my butt and I'll really break a sweat, while an instructor like Jillian will be better for a day I'm sore and need more restorative stretching and slower transitions.\nI have only had extremely positive interactions with not only the instructors, but also the people. It feels very comraderie-like and because of the small size, you don't have to be a stranger.\n\nKatie is an instructor sent from another world. Her ability to flow, correct your form, and target small muscles activating the entire body is unparalleled. Just because this is an exercise that doesn't leave you huffing and puffing, it doesn't mean it isn't intense and powerful. There's a very good chance that if it isn't difficult, it's because the incorrect muscles are being targeted and form is off. Katie is truly beyond gifted in correcting form, as is Jillian. Blair is more for someone who isn't a complete beginner because the transitions are quick with movements requiring proper form. Without proper form in Blair's core combo, you will suffer. That is why I do really recommend the privates before starting with any of the above instructors; they are all my lifesavers. I say that because I have degenerative disc disease, had back surgery at 22, and told my spine would detiorate as I age. When I started pilates I had been experiencing daily hip pain that ached whenever I walked and slept. Couldn't sleep on my side because it hurt so much.\n4 weeks later my hip and back pain is gone. I stand up straighter, activate my core and support myself with my stomach, and am less sore throughout my body in general.\n\nPilates is my MEDICINE.\nInvest in your health... this studio can change your life!
