It's not easy, but I am making it through. I have, for one, have two successful stories and could not have done it without all of the staff doctors, nurses, lab techs, assistants, coordinating assistants,  managers, secretary, clerks, dietary staff, maintenance staff, social workers, navigators and pastoral care. I began my fight with cancer in 2015 and the second time around was  July 29, 2022. I would have never made it through my personal patient experience and journey had it not been for all of the kind services received.
