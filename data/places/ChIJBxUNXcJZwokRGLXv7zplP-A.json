The servers are incredibly friendly and each dish was a work of art. The complementary bread they serve is average, but the 3 dipping sauces were delicious. The meatballs were so flavorful and tender. The cacio e pepe dish was served masterfully in a cheese wheel. It had a more mild cheesy flavor and the thicker spaghetti noodles were a hit. The pollo plate was like a schnitzel dish and that was our favorite! Tender chicken with a crispy coating, drizzled with pesto and served with fresh cherry tomatoes and spinach. Lastly, the plant dessert was a light and sweet ending to the meal. Overall, high quality ingredients with amazing presentation!
