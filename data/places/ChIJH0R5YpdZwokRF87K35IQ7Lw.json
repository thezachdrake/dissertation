The first involved my adult daughter, just returning from her wedding in Mexico. She was extremely ill and went to an ER upon return.  The doctor there refused to test her blood, misdiagnosed her condition and sent her home.  The next day, thanks to a friend, she saw Dr. Saltzman.  He immediately hospitalized her and started treating her for a bacterial infection. which turned out to be infectious colitis. She was in the hospital for 5 days.  Over a year ago, I sensed there was something going on physically that was problematic.  I was suffering with extreme fatigue and a fogginess that I couldn't explain.  My internist did tests, found nothing and then told me perhaps I was depressed and needed to talk to someone. I knew it was more. My blood work started changing  and after seeing a series of specialists, I was getting frustrated. Over a years since I complained of the severe fatigue.  I went to Dr. Saltzman for another problem, a bacterial UTI that would not go away.  He looked at my blood work and told me he was going to treat me for Lymes disease. Within days of taking the meds the fog started to lift and my UTI seemed to be getting better.  He listened to me and that made a big difference. I'd been sent to so many other doctors and the communication between my PCP and them and me was fair at best. I feel like I'm finally on the mend. Thank you Dr. Saltzman for looking at this as a challenge."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have been fortunate enough to cross professional paths with Dr. Saltzman on two occassions.
