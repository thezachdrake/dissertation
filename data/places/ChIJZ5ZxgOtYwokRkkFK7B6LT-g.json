Dr Unger had actually tried to discourage me from a surgery initially to see if I could instead get the results I wanted with medication alone. That patient first attitude is what you want in your surgeon. I live out of state and they were very accommodating with virtual consultations and detailed instructions. And I was referred to her by the CEO of a hair restoration drug company so a highly qualified referral. Its expensive for a reason; with something like your hair you don’t want to take shortcuts. I was shocked how many follicles they were able to successfully transplant, and they added coverage for areas they anticipate i will experience future loss. Go here and thank me later.
