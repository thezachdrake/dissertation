Fast forward to Sunday, they rescheduled my massage to another location in Ny which is extremely inconvenient. They stated they do not provide refunds so you are essentially stuck. It’s been over 48 hours, I had to YouTube how to drain myself because I was leaking fluid everywhere i went. And now I am also losing money because I have to continue to call out of work. Please be mindful when choosing where to have your procedures done. Also, I have yet to receive any post op care instructions. I don’t see how I had to provide payment and lab results so urgently and now i can’t even get someone on the phone to resolve this ongoing matter.
