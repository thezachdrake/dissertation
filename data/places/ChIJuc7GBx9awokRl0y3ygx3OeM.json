The staff and instructors are super friendly and informative.  The facility is always clean and the locker rooms are well stocked so you can go about your day after a really sweaty sesh. The cool tea tree oil face towel at the end of the practice is also a nice touch. This studio is a safe space for beginners but also presents challenges for those who are more advanced. My personal favorite instructor would have to be Ariel, but all of the instructors are worth checking out and bring their own flair and expertise with their flows. You honestly can’t go wrong with any of them. I highly recommend this studio!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Started coming to YogaSpark about a year ago after some yoga experience, and my practice has greatly benefited from frequenting this studio.
