One customer that was about to finish up, then it was just me and another customer who arrived together. This customer was an elderly in a wheelchair -- this is usually irrelevant but will be relevant later.\n\nFor many years I have had the same basic haircut, but I always explicitly say I want the sides to be straight up and NOT to protrude at the top like Wolverine X-Men. Every time, I show several photos of myself with the hair that I liked from immediately after a previous haircut.\n\nThis time, the lady was cutting my hair. As always, I explained clearly what I wanted, and showed the photos. She asked if I wanted a 3 or a 4 for the sides, since I don't remember precisely what I had before, I said a 3, because a 4 sounded wrong.\n\nThe first cause for my frustration: During the haircut, the lady was very distracted. She kept stopping, and talking to the owner, and going into the backroom, and checking her phone, going to the register, etc. Like, for the first 20 minutes, she would work on my hair for 2 minutes, and would stop for 30 seconds for a minute. They spoke what sounded like an eastern European language, so I didn't understand what they were saying, though some of the time, they might have been discussing something related to the other customer in the wheelchair, perhaps he needed some special help or something like that. I could not see because the other customer was behind me, and I did not understand what was being said.\n\nOverall this was VERY SLOW.\n\nThe second cause for frustration: When she was done, it was nowhere like what I showed in the photo. I asked her to trim it further, to make it a 2, because clearly a 3 was also wrong. Now she started to do things faster, like how it should normally be done.\n\nIn the end, my hair looked close enough to what I wanted -- most importantly the \"don't want to look like Wolverine\" part -- so we were done.\n\nBy this time it was already 35 maybe 40 minutes.\n\nWhen I paid, the owner gentleman asked me if the sides were ok -- clearly he could tell I was not satisfied initially -- I said yes they were fine.\n\nI paid the $35, plus $10 tip. Normally I would tip 50% for good haircuts. This time I debated whether to tip at all, and decided to go with $10.\n\nAt home I would spend another 10-15 minutes with an electric shaver to tidy up some other areas.\n\nI gave this experience 3 stars, compared to the 5 stars I gave another barber shop on W 57th st two months ago: they cut my hair exactly how I wanted with one try, in 15 minutes.
