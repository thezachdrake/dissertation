Their computer system went down and I thought they were hacked so I contacted one of the sellers of a product I had in my possession.

The spokesperson seemed to think that so many pumps going out might be an attempt to circumvent sanctions on rogue states since products are 10 times more expensive abroad. If you do business with them take one package for yourself and say a porch pirate took it. They are so bad they can't prove anything.
