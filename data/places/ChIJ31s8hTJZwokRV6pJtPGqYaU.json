I called HSS Hudson Yards PT office and spoke with Jennifer. She told me it was her job to check if I was insured and that said she would get back to me. When I asked for a timeline she said she'd get back to me in 3 weeks time, a week before my appointment. I told her that was a long time for simply verifying eligibility, she said the whole office is backed up for 3 weeks making those calls for people. So at that point in 3 weeks time if I'm not covered I'll need to find another physio and wait an additional month. The hudson yards office is very inefficient and not very courteous either. My guess is this call was just the tip of the iceberg. If it takes 3 weeks to check eligibility, I wonder how long it would take to get a billing error fixed with HSS Hudson Yards."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Made an appointment for physical therapy for a month out with Hudson Yards HSS.

He was detailed, thorough and overall excellent. He also always returned my calls and answered any questions I had within a day. Literally, within a day of getting MRI results I was on the phone with him, and he walked me through the results and what they mean for my treatment. At all times I feel like I know exactly what is happening, why and what are the next steps. As patient, this is extremely important and yet not to be taken for granted - it is not the experience I have had with other spine specialists in NYC. The staff at HSS is also fantastic and it helps that the HSS has their own immaging/radiology department that can get any x rays and MRIs done quickly. I also love that there is a user-friendly HSS app where a patient can see all doctor's notes from past consultations and tests, and schedule or modify any appointments. Well done.
