However, I would NOT recommend this salon to anyone for any service. I went here as I purchased a Groupon for a manicure & pedicure. I had to make an appointment 3 weeks in advance because they didn't have any availability (I thought this was a good sign...NOT!). I saw the manicurist use the same tools on someone else RIGHT after she used them on me WITHOUT cleaning. There was no cleaning spray or disinfectant in sight. This is a serious concern for health and sanitation. Second, I left with nail polish around my nails on my skin. To do the pedicure, she put a puppy pee pad under my feet. I just felt very uncomfortable with this and several other issues at this salon. Lastly, my complaint is with Sherry the hair stylist. I didn't have any hair service provided here, thankfully. But, she had hair dye in her own hair during the entire 90 mins I was in the salon all the while she was working on 2 other customers hair. She also completely lied to a young girl in there receiving a keratin treatment and told her that they are all the same. I have had keratin treatments for a long time at good salons and no, they definitely aren't all the same. Also, she didn't even cover the girls eyes or mouth when drying the hair which is necessary with all the chemicals. This place is so dysfunctional and poorly organized. It's a mess. And not sanitary at all. I regret staying for my appointment with all the hazards."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the owner is very kind and the manicurist was nice also.
