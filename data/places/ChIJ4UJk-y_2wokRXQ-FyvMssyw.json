We look forward every year to when Ellington’s “opens its doors” (aka opens the shutters on the upstairs bar) so that we can enjoy the delicious food and fun bevs there.\nI’m personally a fan of their iced tea, though it’s inconsistent what it’ll taste like each time haha. Sometimes it’s more like an Arnold Palmer. Other times it’s like a classic unsweet iced tea. Most recently, it tasted like raspberry lemon sweet tea. Either way, it’s refreshing and a good option when you aren’t ready for the booze yet. That said — I also enjoy getting the tea spiked with whiskey for those times when I do feel up for the booze!\nThey have a great selection of liquors and a pretty good offering of wines. Beers are great even though I don’t drink beer much — my husband, however, loves the selection.\nThe BEST thing this place makes, though, is their Turkey burger. Hands down the best Turkey burger I’ve had in NYC and that’s why this patio bar gets a solid 4 stars from me! It is SO good and I hope they never change it on the menu.\nThis place is so fun.
