Some rooms are showing audio visual art, personally I felt they should have a separate area so that the sound doesn't create a monotonous ambiance for the entire floor, but I'm not a good judge of art arrangement either which by the way is amazing. The space each art occupies, the combination of them in the wall, the lighting is brilliant. It's really spacious. They have a phone charging station near the museum store on the second floor, so you know what to do! Overall, I'm happy 😊"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This museum is one of the finest museum in NYC and in USA..You start with the 6th floor and go downstairs following the artwork and the direction.
