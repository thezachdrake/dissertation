It's a small park with a children's playground, lots of shade from the trees, some benches and tables, and a dog run. There are a lot of rats at night (probably unavoidable for most nyc parks) and occasionally there might be some sketchy characters at night but generally it's safe. The dog run is ok, it has consistently upgraded over the year (they added water and a better gate) but it's typically dirty, there's a random fence in the middle of it that probably would be better if it wasn't there since dogs run into it and there's always that dog owner that doesn't pick up after their dog's poop. Also, every time I clean my dogs paws after a visit here the water is black, so good luck if your dog rolls in this stuff 😅. Sometimes it can get very dusty, so when the dogs are running around they can kick up dust. Most of the dogs are usually friendly which is nice although in the summer there were a high amount of dog fights that occurred.
