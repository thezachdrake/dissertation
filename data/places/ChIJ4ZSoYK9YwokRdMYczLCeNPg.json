I use your UPS Store location to receive packages and US Mail from a variety of shippers including Fedex and Amazon - besides UPS.  It is not possible for me to file a claim, as you suggest, from a logistics delivery company and that’s what I need to file today.  I had a Staples delivery of 4-items delivered to my UPS STORE BOX ### today.  I did not receive a notice from the store saying it had arrived and because that is not unusual I track shipments diligently to make sure I receive them and they don’t go missing.  When I arrived at the store I was asked multiple times if I was sure I had received a Staples order and I was asked to show the tracking information.  After a brief search the store clerk pulled his cellphone from his pocket, flipped through his gallery, and showed me a picture of a receipt (from inside one of MY received Staples boxes) a receipt addressed to my full name, the UPS Store location, and clearly stating - UPS BOX ###.\nThe clerk asked, “Is this you?”\nI said, “Yes.”\nThe clerk apologized and said he thought the delivery was the Staples order for the store.  The clerk then set about collecting my supplies from various locations in the store where it had been unboxed and put away.  8-reams of paper unboxed and stored, 2x laser toner cartridges stored, and a box of markers withdrawn from an office drawer.  Again, he apologized and was very sorry for the misunderstanding.  I said,”… it's no problem, thanks for pulling all of this together.”  In the past this same clerk has asked me to have my packages addressed to my UPS Box ##.  ALL of my packages are addressed properly, I have shown him more than once that his confusion with finding a package is not due to improper labeling it is due to his not reading the shipping label.  When he showed me MY Staples receipt on his personal phone it’s clearly addressed to my name - it clearly shows my UPS BOX ### on its own line.  The clerk didn’t have my original Staples receipt for some reason, he printed my receipt from the picture on his phone and handed it to me.  I don’t know why he lost or couldn’t produce the original receipt.  Again, I have no alternative for shipping -  so I work with what I have.  I didn’t complain to him or anyone in the office.  I don’t see the point.  The clerks only get angry and frustrated with complaints.
