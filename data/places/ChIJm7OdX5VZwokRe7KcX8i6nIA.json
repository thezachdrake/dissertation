The staff's commitment to ensuring our guests had a memorable experience was truly remarkable. I would encourage anyone interested in hosting an event at 632 on Hudson to use the venue’s preferred caterer, BITE. From the perfectly timed cocktail hour to the exquisite dinner service, we received countless compliments from our friends and family about the quality of the food and the overall service.\n\nThe venue's picturesque rooftop also added an extra layer of charm to our celebration. It allowed for stunning photo opportunities and a serene setting that our guests enjoyed.\n\nIn summary, our wedding at this NYC venue was an absolute dream come true. We couldn't have asked for a more chic and interesting setting to celebrate our special day. The compliments from our guests were a testament to the venue's excellence, and we couldn't be happier with our choice.
