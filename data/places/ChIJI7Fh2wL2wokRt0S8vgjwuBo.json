The chocolate jack daniels one was not boozy enough for me :)... the the cake is delicious! However, the tiramisu one - oh wow!  My absolute favorite. I should have gotten a 6 pack of those! I didn't get to sample the others, as my son took them all back to school with him, but I'm sure they were delicious!\n\nI highly recommend and will be ordering again!\n\nBTW - the fact that the cupcakes are nut free is huge as my son also has a tree nut allergy. Sometimes it can be hard to find a nut free bakery that is actually good!"},"publishTime":"2023-08-28T20:11:44Z"}],"dineIn":false,"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7927735802915,"longitude":-73.94540281970849},"low":{"latitude":40.7900756197085,"longitude":-73.9481007802915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":14,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":19,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":11,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":19,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":11,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":19,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":11,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":19,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":11,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":19,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":11,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":19,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":11,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":19,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Thursday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Friday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Saturday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Sunday: 2:00 – 7:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"1673 Lexington Ave, New York"}
