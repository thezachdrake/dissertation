I was a member of 1106 for about 8 years and a memeber of 1101 the rest. When I was a member of 1106 I really felt a part of a union and still have many good friends from that experience. As a member of 1101 it has been quite different. This union is very cliquy and if you are not part of the inner group this union will not recognize you. As a steward for 1101 I witnessed very disturbing labor disputes where the union settled in order to preserve “special “ privileges. As a steward I always fought the good fight and stood with members who also felt the same. Some of these people I even helped get elected on to the executive board of the union only to find out they where no better than the previous selfish leaders. I was hurt on the job and at one point in the ICU. My union didn’t even send a card. Thankfully my brothers and sisters took it upon themselves to take a collection in support of my family and myself. My union never grieved the company when I didn’t get paid had to do it myself. When the company tried to fire me 3 times they did nothing had to fight myself. Recently I asked my chief and business agent ( both people I helped get elected) to file grievances and was met with combative language every time. They even told me, in the past, I had no grievance only to contact payroll to be told I was owed money. So far these guys are bothered doing the bare minimum. The kicker is even though I’m not elegible to be paid anymore because I’ve been out so long but they still are collecting my dues. I’ve tried to go back to work on modified duty, something many have been offered in the time I’ve been out, to be told they have nothing for me. I’ve reached out to the President and Vice President only to receive more combative conversation from my business agent. The most recent slap in the face was being recently decertified by my business agent with no reason what so ever. Not saying unions are bad this is just my sincere experience hope it helps you understand what 1101 is really about. Next time you see them on strike just know the people who put them on strike are still making 6 figure salaries while the members march with no pay."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve been a member for 21 years.
