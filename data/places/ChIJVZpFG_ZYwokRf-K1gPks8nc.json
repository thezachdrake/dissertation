That was not an option for me so I opted to manage the situation as best I could.\n\nIn December 2016 my hips started hurting me more and I knew that I had to address my situation. After extensive searching, I found Dr Borenstein and contacted him via his website. I was pleasantly surprised to get a call from him that same evening, during which we discussed my treatment options and made arrangements for him to review my records. After reviewing my xrays and report, he advised me that stem cell therapy was a viable option for me, and invited me to make an appointment for treatment.\n\nWhen I arrived for my treatment I was greeted by Dr Borenstein, who seemed very affable. After completing my sign in forms we went through the consultation, during which I was advised of the potential risks and benefits of the procedure, what to expect of the treatment and my recovery phase, and discussed any other issues that might be affecting me as a result of my condition. I was quite surprised when, on hearing that I had back issues, he requested my MRI and indicated that he would treat that too!\n\nThe procedure itself was quite straighforward. Liposuction from the right buttocks, an hour long stroll around Lincoln Centre while the stem cells were separated, the extraction of blood, plasma separation, locating the injection sites and the injection of the stem cells and plasma all took 3 1/2 hrs, including my back.\n\nDid it hurt? Yes! Probably a 5 on the childbirth scale and a solid 10 on the man flu scale. But after the lidocaine injection into the hip after the stem cells, the pain that I had lived with for years was gone! My range of motion was 100% better immediately after the procedure and has remiained that way for two weeks so far.\n\nDr Borenstein has checked up on me at least every other day since the procedure and continues to be pleased with my progress. I have recommended him to at least 6 people so far and would encourage others to check with him before making a decision that you may regret for the rest of your life.\n\nWith physiotherapy, my prognosis for getting back to running is looking good.

As time went by, arthritis took over and changed my life dramatically.  I live in upstate New York were the cold weather can be an enemy for people with arthritis.  During this time, I saw four (4) different specialists who could not do anything but give me cortisone and gel shots which only lasted a few months and provided “minimal” relief.  I walked around holding on to the walls feeling as if my knees were going to crumble at any moment.  The last specialist wanted to do a partial knee replacement for each knee, which I couldn’t understand as I am only in my mid-40’s!  In search of different alternatives, I did a lot of research into the Stem Cell treatment and decided to meet with Dr. Borenstein.  He answered my every question, phone call and email with amazing knowledge, professionalism, sympathy and understanding.\nI was very skeptical at first but felt I needed to exhaust every other avenue before going ahead with such a dramatic and permanent solution as partial knee replacement surgery. I scheduled and received the stem cell treatment November 2016 and the recuperation has been mind-blowing in an awesome and very positive way.  Just six days after treatment, I was able to stretch my knees in bed!  I cannot even tell you when was the last time I was able to do that without feeling that knees would crack.  Little by little, I started feeling better each day. I was no longer doing the “penguin” walk (especially when getting out of bed). Cold days were more manageable and not as painful as they once were.  Day 10th was amazing to me; I was super busy at work and took the stairs, walking down one leg in front of the other (a thought that no longer existed on my mind) and when I realized what I was doing, a HUGE smile of happiness took over!  Since then, everyday has been better and better! Dr. Borenstein has been there for me every step of the way, answering my every text message, cheering me up and giving me the life back that I so desperately needed.  I cannot believe that the FDA will approve the knee replacement surgery, where they will actually CUT your own bones (which is irreversible), but they won’t approve a stem cell treatment that comes from ones own body!  When I go to Physical Therapy (to strengthen my muscles) and I see people there screaming of pain from their knee surgeries and my heart aches for them.  I thank God every day for crossing my path with Dr. Borenstein before it was too late!\nIf you have been told you need surgery, do yourself a HUGE favor and contact Dr. Borenstein first.
