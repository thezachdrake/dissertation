I am so lucky to have stumbled upon Stacy's studio all of those years ago. Thanks, Styles on B, for sharing your professionalism, creative skill, great energy, and kindness with each person who walks through your doors! P.S. the salon is dog friendly, so check with them to see if you can bring your fur baby along for your appointment.
