Most have arrived without incident. But last month I ordered a changing table for my baby - a pretty essential item! - knowing that I had to have it as soon as I moved into my apartment. I ordered in early September, and the ship date listed was Sept 24-25. I heard nothing (didn't expect to) and then on September 24 gotten an automated email saying that the item had been cancelled. I called customer service to ask why, was put on hold several times for a total of about 20 minutes, and finally spoke to someone who said she didn't know why it had been cancelled but that she would lodge my complaint and I would be hearing from a customer service representative. I thought that would mean contact with a human who at the very least could help explain what happened and maybe guide me to a similar piece which they could ship expedited. Instead I got another automated email reiterating that the item had been cancelled. Anyway, the whole thing was extremely disappointing. This is the first time in my life I've posted a negative review of a company on line, but I feel like I gave them multiple chances to explain the problem and help resolve it and instead I just got totally indifferent customer service from a robot. I will not be ordering from them again.\n\nUPDATE: In the last 6 weeks, I have placed 5 separate orders with One King's Lane. Of those, two arrived on schedule and were perfectly lovely. Now two (one in addition to the one mentioned above) have been cancelled outright a month after placing the order, and within days of the scheduled ship date. The fifth has been backordered for several months - again, something I wasn't told until weeks after I placed the order. So, the company has only a 40% success rate in getting me the orders I placed. They have not offered any explanation for these multiple problems. Clearly, they are a good curator but have either terrible relationships with their vendors or terrible communication. Of all of the companies I have worked with in decorating my apartment, they are by far the least reliable and also the least helpful from a customer service standpoint.
