Originally, the surgery was to have been done at Mt. Sinai's Union Square location, but the hospital very abruptly cancelled due to some training they were conducting.  I very much appreciated that Dr. Horn was sensitive to the fact that I had carefully planned the timing of the surgery.  Rather than reschedule, she went out of her way to contact colleagues to arrange an alternative site on the same date.  She performed the surgery in a private facility opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  It was a fabulous experience - more like a spa than a hospital surgical theater but just as rigorous in terms of cleanliness etc.  I have enjoyed her friendliness and candor throughout the entire process.
