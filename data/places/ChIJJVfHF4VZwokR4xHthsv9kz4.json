They were kind enough to cut it in half for me and my companion.\n\nThe sandwich was quite large. It had the fried chicken, the Nanban sauce, cabbage, and slices of pickled daikon. The chicken was super juicy and soft - so delicious! We were just slightly disappointed by the breading of the chicken - we felt it could've covered the chicken more (some spots had no breading) and been a bit crispier.\n\nGiven that the chicken is greasy (obviously since it's fried) and the sauce seems to be mayo based, the sandwich did get a bit heavy after a while - 2 of us split the sandwich.\n\nI would recommend this place for those that like fried chicken sandwiches but not sure I would visit again myself.
