(The Church objects to actual candles, so they give you tiny battery operated ones.) The tour is hosted by Tommy's New York, and our tour guide was Leo. He is very knowledgeable, and funny.  After gathering across the street from the Church, the tour starts inside the Church itself. Leo explained some history of the church, what happened during the fire, and how it was rebuilt. He also pointed out the area inside where the christening scene in The Godfather was filmed. We got to take pictures inside (The Church doesn't mind flash photography, but no audio is allowed), and then headed upstairs to the choir area and behind the large organ. (You can see the old stones that were placed on the bellows). From there, we walked into a room under the Church for a brief discussion (The Church is located within the Five Points, yes, just like the movie The Gangs of New York), then into the catacombs.  Now, if you are thinking of the creepy ones from Indiana Jones, or maybe Paris, that isn't what you will find. You will find some of the wealthiest New Yorkers (for the times), a few of the first Cardinals in NY, the Delmonicos (you know the name if you are from here), people who brought opera to the city, and so many more. While this is a timed walk, Leo made sure to point out the people who made a huge impact on the city. Afterwards, you get to walk through a portion of the cemetery. You can tell the age of the stones because most can not be read anymore. This was a very enjoyable tour, and Leo was a terrific guide. If you would like to do something a little unique, I recommend the Catacombs by Candlelight tour."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Visited Old St. Patrick's Cathedral for a Catacombs by Candlelight tour on Saturday evening.
