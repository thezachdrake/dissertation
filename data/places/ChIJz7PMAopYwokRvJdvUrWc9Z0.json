You are greeted every day at the door by staff who monitor the facility. I look forward to the weekly email showcasing what they learned and how they interacted with each other so you can see progress and reflect with your child about different topics. They also offer valuable speakers and events for families so we can all navigate the New York education system and have fun during these precious years. It speaks volumes about socialization skills when your child wants to play with their friends every day of the week. We are so thankful for finding Rutgers!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Rutgers Community Programs is a hidden gem on the UWS.
