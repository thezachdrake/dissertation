Wanted to write a review of the good, bad & ugly of life at RY Condos. The Good: a) They have something you don't see in Manhattan: economic diversity, esp a ton of lower-middle-income residents. Was a middle-income Mitchell Lama & most of the old residents bought & stayed or rented when it converted in 2000's. So you also have lots of elderly residents. B) Great location to raise kids. Schools, activities, Ruppert Park & the building is kid friendly. The nannies & kids play in both the lobby & the hallways & no one cares. You can keep your gear outside your apt in the hallway & no one bothers it. The Bad: a) Management is useless. \"DB\" supposedly runs the place but she is utterly clueless. The place is run by the doormen & the Head of Security who we call \"Crazy Ray.\" We had a problem with a few of our neighbors esp the \"Cat Lady\" & an old man with a dog (yes, it says No Dogs Allowed but that's not true, they are all over the place). We tried to handle it ourselves b/c management is useless but ended up taking it to the doormen (H.S. & R.I. & their crew @ 1601) & the problems disappeared quickly. b) Don't mess with the doormen (see A). Like everything, holiday tipping is different at\nRY; they send around a flyer with a rate based on the size of your apt. Pay it in full or more. Every year the doorman \"R.W.\" announces how much you tipped them as you walk into the building after work so everyone hears. c) Rent from Owner like we did. Talk about people hearing, you can find out basically anything you want about your neighbors who rent directly from RY Management. Want to know what someone does for a living, where they moved from or to -- just ask the doormen (who call themselves Security). Way beyond the typical building staff gossiping. Avoid RY, avoid your personal info freely available. d) If you are going to buy/own, better pay your Common Charges. On the Bulletin Board in the lobby they post a list of all owners who haven't paid them & their addresses. e) Maintenance is a joke. From the looks of the apt's of friends who rent directly from RY, the chronic complaints about Maintenance are true. And from some of the common areas. See the Laundry Room bathroom; they allow everyone who delivers to use it (probably why the 5 star reviews from delivery men). It makes a truck stop bathroom look squeaky clean. f) Oh, the Laundry Room. Our poor nanny would have to wait forever for a machine! A few of the other nannies have a side hack doing laundry for residents; they are in the Laundry Room from AM to PM. Management knows & doesn't care. Unless you use them to do your laundry you have to give it to the Cleaners who run the Valet. g) Like the \"No Dogs\" policy,  most of the Amenities they advertise don't exist. They don't have a Gym they have a NYSC in the building next door. My husband joined the first year; he paid way more with the \"resident discount\" than if he had just joined using a promotion open to the public. The garage is a GGMC that charges well over $400. a month. No resident discount. The storage? Those are private units sold to owners. Again, you are allowed to leave your stuff in the hallway but still. Amenities: doormen, a patio no one uses off the filthy laundromat & the Valet. h) The decor is from the late 70's or 80's. Update. So. Needed. The Ugly (other than the decor): a) Elevator Modernization = Hell. I worried about my kids using the elevators in 1601 3rd so we though having the elevators \"modernized\" was great. 40-45 mins waiting for an elevator? Jammed in with all those people? This going for months. Not. Great. Hell. b) Word to the wise. Avoid \"Crazy Ray\" at all costs. Remember, he & a lot of the staff are your neighbors, so he is around all the time. Smile. Move on. He is an absolute loon & since he runs the place can make your life hell. Talking about loon-y, he's easily recognized because he looks exactly like the toon who says: \"Th-th-th-that's all folks.\""},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"After several years living in 1601 3rd it's time to move into our new home in Jersey!
