Not certain what qualifies it as a medical facial - it was essentially a wash, some poorly executed extractions and mask with some product. No frills but will run you $300 easy. Would strongly recommend another, more professional location."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Highly dissatisfactory experience.
