You can get the National  brands at a competitive price comparable to the chains, as well as the less expensive generics. If you have any questions, the pharmacist is never to busy to drop what he is doing to answer. My prescriptions are filled monthly on time and accurate. I receive a phone call  telling me they are available for pick up. When I arrive I am greeted by name.  If I bring a new prescription there is  generally little to no wait time. In addition  the friendly pharmists are easy to talk to so I never feel embarrassed to ask those personal health concern questions I might have. They understand my needs and have only my better health  in mind. A true judgement free zone. This is the personal service I was looking for and is well worth the time I travel to get there. Plus they are located close an eclectic array of restaurant's and stores to fill any and all a shopaholics desires. So if you are feeling disappointed with the big chains as I was. Nagle pharmacy in Inwood is the place to go for all your general drug store and Rx needs. Whether you live close-by or not. It is worth the trip.  I also like the idea of contributing my hard earned $$ to the little guys who support and are actively involved in the well being and betterment of the thriving and diverse community that is Inwood.
