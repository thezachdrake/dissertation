We walk in and sit at the bar, the bartender comes over to get our order and asks for our IDs. One of my friends realized she didn’t have her physical ID, but she had a picture of it and she was able to use that before as acceptable form of ID in previous bars so she asked if that would suffice. The bartender said that she couldn’t accept the photo ID, which we understood and did not argue. She obviously was no longer going to get a drink anymore and my other friend and I pulled out our IDs to show the bartender and thought everything was fine after that.\n\nA few minutes after, this older woman, who I assume is the owner, comes out yelling at my friend and demeaning her for asking if the photo of the ID would be acceptable or not. We hadn’t been asked to leave, or told that there was a problem before this, all that was said to us by the bartender was that the photo wasn’t acceptable but that it was okay for me and my other friend to order our shots (since we had our physical ID with us to show). The yelling was so loud that I told her she did not need to be screaming at us and then she started to victimize herself and say “Oh cause I’m such a c*nt, yeah I’m a c*nt” when no one had even attacked her or said anything negative to her.\n\nIt was a very shocking and honestly dehumanizing experience to have a much older white woman screaming at 3 young 23 year old POC publicly like that instead of addressing the issue in a polite and civil manner as a business owner should in this situation. She was also very visibly drunk which I think also heightened her inappropriate behavior.\n\nWe never had a issue with the bartender stating that a photo ID isn’t acceptable. If they had asked us to leave because of it, we would be more than happy to oblige. But no one said anything to us and the bartender took my and my other friend’s ID. This whole situation was just really unnecessary and I truly hope no one ever has to experience what we did here.\n\nThe target clientele for this bar is definitely catered to older white people (40-60+) and if any POC or anyone looking for basic level of decency are reading this review, I seriously think you should reconsider going here as the treatment we received was not acceptable at all."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My two friends and I (all 23) stopped here to get a quick shot on the way to our night plans after looking up bars in the area with what looked like good reviews.
