Most of the doormen have been around in the building for decades. Anthony in particular, the lead doorman, is the best of the best. He’s like the dad everyone wishes they had and he’d do anything for you. Hector and the other maintenance stuff fix things within minutes, literally, and are always supportive. There’s also a Valet service in the basement that provides amazing tailoring and dry cleaning. The woman who runs it could not be nicer!! I don’t have kids, but it seems like all the kids programming they offer and the kids room are a huge hit and keep all the families in the building happy. It can be really hard to find a place that truly feels like home in NY and the staff at the Colorado actually make me feel like wanting to come home. It’s a really safe building and the location is convenient for quick grab and go food and some nice sit down restaurants. Lastly, I wanted to reiterate that it’s very hard to find good management companies in the city, and this one is top notch. Arianna especially would always say hi to me in the building, respond promptly to my emails, provide support on any financial questions and was great to work with when we were signing our lease / moving in. I can no longer afford the building now that COVID pricing is over and I’ve never been more sad to leave a place. This is literally my second Google review ever which shows how genuinely I want people to know that this place is worth the money.
