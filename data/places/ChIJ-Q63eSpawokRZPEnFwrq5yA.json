Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a security job. The pay is very low. It's a residential area with a bunch of spoiled rich people who are very rude to you if you don't buzz them even though they have a key. The shift supervisors have a combined IQ of 7, their main goal is to write you up for any little mistake you make. They provide you with a stool to sit on but you could only sit the last 15 minutes of every hour. There's one supervisor in particular whose mother never hugged him when he was child. He's married with children but still acts like a miserable person and bullies everyone. Also you can't work in this place if you have a life. You'll get forced into doing alot of double shifts even if you tell them you can't. Even if you have a valid reason. Even if your relief is here they'll still force you to do another shift in another building. The supervisors don't care about the guards. They don't stand up for the guards. They don't want to see you comfortable or happy. The place is short staffed which is no surprise because the atmosphere of this place does not match the pay. Also there's a parking lot for employees but only the supervisors are allowed to park there. You will be treated like trash by the residents, supervisors and management."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I don't know about living here but working here is horrible.
