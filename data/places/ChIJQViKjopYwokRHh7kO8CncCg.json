When I got in the office , there were two ladies one of her names were Melissa, she was very upset, I've tried to explain her about the situation with the elevator, but she was in a very bad mood and started being impolite and rude. That day I could say was one of my worst days with American Laser Skin Care. I've notice a big difference between the very polite service I used to have in Boca Raton Florida and the service I receive from these two inexperienced girls. They were very rude all the time not only in the way they behave, but at the same time they were making ugly face all the time.\nAt the end of the service I was very confused, and I started to get upset. One of these two impolite ladies asked me to sing a form. I refused to do it due to the poor quality service I've received.\n\nAt this point I'm feeling like I never want to go back to this location...  I feel very frustrated, and I do not understand why companies like this have people that do not have the attitude to treat customers in a very good way.\n\nI was offered this Treatment  for about  $1,000.00, and I was treated like my money does not worth . I make a very big effort to make the monthly payments on time .\n\nI know there are other ladies that work with professionalism, they are very polite and they love their job .
