There were items inside from the previous renter, including moldy coffee cups in the cupholders. The left side mirror was broken, all 4 tires needed air, and many of the engine notices were on.

The van had been off and parked the entire time we were loading. We had to wait an hour for roadside assistance. I will say, roadside assistance provides us with great customer service.\n\nWe return the van and a taxi cab is blocking the uhual parking spots, while he is inside hanging out with the gas station attendant. They both clearly see us but the taxi cab driver does not move. We finally get the van parked and again we are unable to verify the mileage. The attendant is on a personal call outside by this point. He finally gets off the phone and helps us get the mileage reading.\n\nIt was a nightmare, in the 14 degree weather.\n\nI reached out to U-Hail and received an email stating that upper management would reach out to me in 3 days.
