But now I work in healthcare and what I do requires standing a lot and sometimes weird positions so I finally asked her for a session. For my session we focused on my upper body and back and it felt so good! Not only did my spine and ribs feel lengthened it was also just a relaxing session that allows you to reconnect with your body. The best way I can describe it was a mix between vinyasa flow yoga and pilates, lots of intentional movement with breaths. I think it's worth trying and this is a small intimate studio in Harlem, you get personalized attention and very experienced hands.
