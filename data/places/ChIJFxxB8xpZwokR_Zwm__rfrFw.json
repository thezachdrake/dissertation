Clayton helped test our apartment for mold, lead, and asbestos, after our ceiling fell in half of our apartment, after the upstairs neighbor accidentally left the water on.

They obtained multiple sampling, was very professional, very knowledgable and an expert in this field. I urge anyone with any doubts about what environmental poisons may be in their home or apartment, to call ECC. Clayton will walk you through the process, get your results rapidly, and accurately. Thanks so much! Dont trust your landlord, take matters into your own hands to protect your family. Call ECC and speak to Clayton.
