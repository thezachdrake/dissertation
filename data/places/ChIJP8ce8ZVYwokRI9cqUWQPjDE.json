This review is strictly about my surgery/recovery experience, not focused on results of my hair transplant thus far. I received an FUT hair transplant with 1810 grafts and I'm writing this review 2 weeks after my procedure at the Manhattan location.\n\nMy maxim care team was Dr. Bernard, Cristine (love her she is awesome), Maria, and Candace. Overall, the team was very professional and took great care of me. What I love is that Maxim only does 1 surgery a day, so for that day all the focus/attention is on making sure your surgery is successful. The team sensed my nerves during the surgery, and they constantly gave words of encouragement, and communicated each step they were performing during the surgery.\n\nThe entire process (surgery prep, surgery, post care instructions) took about 10-11 hours. During the surgery prep, Dr. Barnard in detail the 4 medications he prescribed (pain meds, sleep meds, swelling meds, infection meds). I appreciated that he took the time to explain the importance of each medication and the best way to take them for optimal recovery results. He also discusses in detail his plan of action to address the transplant. My FUT focused on my hair line. Because the surgery takes a while, there were times where my body ached from laying in 1 position. Because the team constantly ask you how you are feeling, I was able to stand and release the aches at least 2 times.\n\nAfter the procedure, they make sure that they provide everything needed for your post-op care. I appreciated that Christine explained the aftercare directions with me and answered any clarifying questions.\n\nRecovery overall was not the worst. Pain wise I did not have much. For the most part my head felt sore, but it was bearable. I had difficulty finding a comfortable position to sleep because the donor area is to the back of my head, and I had stiches. The worst part of the healing process was the swelling. I had to constantly ice/massage my face. However, within a week post-surgery majority of my swelling went away. Currently, I got my stitches removed from my donor area and it is healing well. I feel once fully healed the scar will be minimal (thin line as expected) All of scabs are gone and I am left with tiny hairs (which is to be expected). I feel overall I will get my expected results in the end. My grade of hair is not the thickest, so I do plan to follow up with PRP sessions in about 3-4 months to maximize results.\n\nI want to say a special thank you to Michael, who I believe is their lead consultant or Director. He provided timely responses to all my questions during this process thus far. Michael has been extremely helpful and checked in many times to ensure that I'm doing well. I'm very grateful for his help and guidance.\n\nAs stated above, this review is only about my surgery/recovery experience, not focused on results of my hair transplant thus far. I am still very early in the process and will share an update in the coming months. But overall, if you are looking for professional services that overall is affordable (competitive price based on all other transplant companies I consulted with), and treats you like an MVP the entire process, I would recommend Maxim."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My experience with Maxim thus far has been nothing short of amazing.
