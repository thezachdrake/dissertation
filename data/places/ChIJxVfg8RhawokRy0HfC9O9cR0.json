deceitful Trial attorney. A 4th Dept. Justice was not impressed with his oral argument where Mr. Bluestone was clearly remiss of the facts.  Yet over the year, I recall  he could only offer one word responses via computer. What I have now realized is that the attorneys representing my former trial attorney submitted a fraudulent letter drafted  by the Church attorney! Because getting Joanne off the hook at any costs mattered more than honesty. This letter by Hall was NEVER accepted or entered in as evidence at the time of the trial. This manufactured evidence was drafted by a church attorney hoping the trial judge would go for it. He didn't. I was on the witness stand and the Judge walked in front of me and handed it back; as if to say; \"nice try\".  Why did Mr. Bluestone not remember no one in my area wanted to challenge the Church and or Town. I made this clear so how was I suppose to find an expert when my attorney was not responding to any of my communications?\nMr. Bluestone should humble himself to the facts instead of creating more confusion by grandstanding. His job was to know that the available evidence at my attorney's disposal was NEVER USED.  During the oral argument he lacked an understanding of the fact that my attorney failed to provide the appraisal showing devaluation of my property. This was a large financial loss.\nClearly he never intended to dispute the claim made by the defense or initiate any consultation on the disputed issues. He didn't know the facts and it was clear to the Appellate Justice.\nHis refusal to have any conferences about the issues is rather peculiar. Mr. Bluestone relied on generalized statements that could be considered \"Boiler-plate\" themes and could not speak succinctly that included engaging, clarifying and showing sincerity. He needs to realize this case represented 8 years and he bungled the delivery due to a cavalier attitude. His words \"they didn't like it\"; was also misinterpreted. His performance was off point and they the justices were not impressed.\n\nHe was paid more than to format the record which Btw he was anxious to finalize within 12 days of retaining him and judged that it was in my interest to leave out critical testimony before a Supreme Court Justice. Today I had a 25 minute discussion about this experience with a more accomplished professional. If an attorney is unwilling to make time after he is hired; I believe I should have backed out and suffered the financial consequences. He also had the monetary terms to his advantage early on along with a non-committal  agreement devoid of this Motion for Summary Judgement. The facts were available to Bluestone, but he couldn't be bothered. And it was his job to do more.\n\nIf your skillset is 50% in litigation why would you not include and and make any mention by citing any of these facts in your support of me? Yes, My basement filled with water  but equally the entire lot on which the home was built  in 1878 was also compromised and devalued by 50%. I was out of my home for nearly 19 months and got ill from the mold; displacing the family for 9 years due to now a more upgraded negligence claim against a Town and Church that refused to answer for this poorly constructed drainage system. My engineer was a credible  expert* also never referenced by you.  The drainage system never worked and this was outlined in my *4th Department Decision in 2011; which you never give any mention or credit to.   Yet,  you don't reference this higher Court decision in my favor.   I lost all damages* compensation for permanent damage related to the devaluation of  home and land that was now deemed permanent.\n\nAs an Expert in Legal Malpractice you equivocated on the issue instead of providing factual information."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"It was my misfortune to hire Bluestone, who once he had the money in hand failed to delve into the issues and counter the false claims of a deceitful Trial attorney.
