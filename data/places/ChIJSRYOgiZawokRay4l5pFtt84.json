Finding this lovely little hole in the wall and the friendly baristas got me out of my funk. Had a strong little macchiato and the day's last danish (it was around 1330 or so) and peppered the ladies with questions, which they happily obliged. There is a historic church across the street and Alfred E. Smith's home is just now the street. It is amazing to look at the accompanying 1766 map. Find Oliver Street and note there is nothing along it, notice how much closer the East River was and the orchard to the NE.
