It's well seasoned and even though the meat can be better, the pho is amazing!!. Their grilled pork with sticky rice was also well seasoned and tasty . They offered some Asian beers which they were very subtle . I really liked them.  The place is very cozy and even tho is not too spacious they offer outside eating.  Overall I haven't try everything in their menu but all of their dishes I've try were very delicious and I recommend anyone who wants pho or Asian good to come and try this spot.  The staff are some of the best and kindest people I've came across .
