All that said, his accessibility, and ability to help patients feel accepted, comfortable, supported, and understood has to be his paramount strengths. While I'm a parent with children of all ages, from toddler to teenager, who was assisted by Dr. Rouse in my parenting, he works with pre - adolescents, and adolescents extensively.  He is well - suited for this population, because he seems to inherently understand their behavioral, and developmental needs, challenges and strengths, and can form an alliance with them, built on trust and positive results.  The fact that kids can talk to him about almost anything - from Apps, culture, music, and technology - to deeper issues, I think helps kids feel like they are seeing a provider they can relate to, and one that doesn't take himself too seriously.\n\nDr. Rouse's office is on the Upper East Side, has a Mid - Century Modern look, is clean and warm, and has a gender neutral bathroom.  There is a paid parking garage nearby, and street parking.  His practice is open until 2000, which is great for kids or parents that want a coveted after - school time slot.  $$$ out of $$$$$, and all major credit cards are accepted, as well as an invoice that you can submit to your health insurance carrier.  All in all, I'm a better parent, and my children are happier, because of my work with Dr. Rouse.  I would recommend Dr. Rouse."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Rouse weekly to better my parenting skills for nearly 1 year.
