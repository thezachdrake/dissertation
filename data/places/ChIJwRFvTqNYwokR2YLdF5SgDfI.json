When asked to pay I offered a card, but they said there machine was broken and they would take down my card number, which felt fishy to me. They then told me I could go next door to the deli atm and get money from there, which is annoying because there is a surcharge to use an atm like that. Since I wanted to get out of there I agreed, but said I needed to dry my nails first. The owner said okay, but we are closing soon, so you need to hurry up. Really?!!!! I waited a half hour for anyone to start my pedicure because for some reason you thought I wasn’t a customer. I dried my nails for 3 minutes before they rushed me out to get money.
