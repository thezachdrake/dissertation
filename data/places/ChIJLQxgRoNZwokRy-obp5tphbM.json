She's an extremely social girl and people on the street will always ask what rescue we used, and if we recommend them - the answer is always no. I have had dogs and worked with dogs for 25 years, and Stevie made them all look like a walk in the park. When I initially had her as a foster, I sought out help from Social Tees and they told me I was wrong, Stevie was categorically not a difficult dog. Even though they had met her for less than 5 minutes, they did not take my experiences witnessing her anxiety, reactivity, and biting into consideration. After a few weeks of fostering, I felt that I was the person best suited to continue to work with Stevie and give her a forever home. I reached out to adopt her, and was told a stranger reached out the day prior. Social Tees has arbitrary rules in place in which the person who reaches out first has \"dibs\". They would prefer to uproot and re-home a dog with unbelievable amounts of trauma because someone reached out to express interest a day before I did. It then fell on me, the foster parent, to interview this person. The potential adopter told me they had never had a dog, and said verbatim \"I am not really a dog person\" - how their application was approved for a 1 year old rescue dog with severe trauma is beyond me. They also worked 8 hour days out of home, making them a terrible match for a dog with separation anxiety. This all seemed obvious to me but I had to fight tooth and nail to convey my concerns to the Social Tees team. Funny enough, I reached out to let the team know Stevie was having a medical concern and needed to see a vet and they suddenly let me know I would be the one adopting Stevie and could go ahead pay out of pocket. I doubt Social Tees remembers Stevie or this situation, because never once did I feel like Social Tees had Stevie's best interest in mind, or that she was a priority.\n\nI'm so grateful I got her out of that situation, where she lives happily as our number one priority.
