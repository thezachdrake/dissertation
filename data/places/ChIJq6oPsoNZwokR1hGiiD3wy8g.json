He also gave us some recommendations, including an off menu item called Fire and Ice. This dish is a definite MUST. Spreading it on their homemade, warm, and crusty bread was almost a religious experience. Our waitress guided us the rest of the way and encouraged us to look at the menu like a tasting. This is DEFINITELY how you should approach the menu. You are not going to get an entree sized pasta. What you will get though is a few small perfectly cooked ravioli in a delectable broth that explode your tastebuds with a smooth and silky veal. Highlights were the fire and ice, potatoes, and ravioli. Extra points go to the free bread that was phenomenal. It shows they put thought into every element of the meal.
