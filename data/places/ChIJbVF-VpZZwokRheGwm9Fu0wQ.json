The bar area seems very bougie, but the rest of the restaurant is not.\n\nWe ordered the guacamole ($16), huevos rancheros ($17), and quesadilla ($17). The guacamole was tasty, but I thought the chips were a tad oily and tough. I could have demolished the guac with some Tostitos. My friend ordered the quesadilla and mentioned the most distinguishing factor was the use of oaxaca cheese, which elevated the taste. I thought the huevos rancheros were good, but nothing special. I think if the chips are made the same way as the tortillas, I just don't like the way this restaurant makes them / the source they are bought from.\n\nService was great, albeit a tad aggressive. However, it was not aggressive to push us out! It seemed like the staff was striving to be extremely hospitable. For example, I still had my fork in my hand and a bit of beans and a slice of egg left, and one of the staff tried to take my plate away. After this, they still refilled our waters, so that's how I know they were not trying to kick us out. Overall, I think prices are reasonable for the location, so it's a solid spot to check out in the area."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My friend and I decided to check out La Contenta Oeste at 1:30pm on a Saturday.
