The courtyard provides a nice space to get some fresh air and is well landscaped in the warmer months. I enjoyed having my meals looking out of the window. The location was convenient and safe.

The compound is definitely on the older side and not brand new/shiny like a new built but the interiors are clean, has everything you need and it is safe which was most critical for me.
