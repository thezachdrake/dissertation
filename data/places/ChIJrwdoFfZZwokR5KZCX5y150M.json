I gave it the benefit of doubt because the hotel just opened.\n\nSecond time I was getting breathed on so much while getting massaged.  She also stopped 15 min early on accident.

I shouldn’t have to tell her that she didn’t complete the 60 minutes.\n\nThird time I had a nice one with no issues.

They Apologized .\n\nNow 4th time, my husband came. I asked in advance for spa to tell the specialists to wear a mask. It’s not just about covid anymore. There are many viruses now and would prefer to not catch anything. The specialist had the mask on, but then asked if she would wear it half the time. I said no I would prefer the whole time. I said why? Then proceeded to tell me she is claustrophobic etc etc in a rude way. Then gave a few dramatic coughs. It was so weird and I definitely didn’t want someone who had a problem with me, touching me. So I then asked if this is going to be problem and do you want to switch”? . She was more than happy too and bolted out of the room to trade to massage my husband.\nThen I got someone else who was sweet and she was good …but not amazing. But I knocked over an empty juice bottle on the floor that wasn’t mine, she had a loud timer that went off when we were finished. I didn’t ask but the spa didn’t give a discount after spending almost $700 on a weird uncomfortable interaction.\n\nSo I would say 1/4 times it was nice massage.
