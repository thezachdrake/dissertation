On sunny warm days the park is but a few steps away. I got a latte and it was wonderfully perfect. Theirs a nice selection of pastries but the cinnamon coffee cake is awesome. I bought two slices. It was really yummy. Theirs soft music playing in the background and it won’t distract you with whatever task you’re doing or just relaxing. The baristas, Gio and Rahim are friendly and attentive.
