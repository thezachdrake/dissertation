Turns out that since NYU had declared 37 weeks as the magical number for delivery, other hospitals refused to go against that advice due to legal liability, so the woman felt forced to return to NYU.\n\nSpoiler alert: my baby was in the NICU due to underdeveloped lungs for 9 days and it was extremely traumatic. When I went for my 6 week appointment I laid out how unheard I felt and how upset I was at how I was treated. The midwife who ran the appointment marked me down as “depressed” (I only saw this later in the notes, she didn’t say this to me) and then never properly followed up. So on top of everything, they ignored what they felt was post partum depression.\n\nI get that the medical system is broken and that these doctors are probably desensitized and burnt out but if you want a pregnancy and birth experience where you are treated like a person whose opinion matters at all, steer clear of this office."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My health insurance isn’t great, so I had limited options.
