We had no intention of buying a ring on this trip but we'd been daydreaming about another ring ever since my original heirloom diamond ring was stolen from my home four years ago. They had top quality gem stones and beautiful settings, so we tried a few and fell in love with one in particular, an incredible canary diamond, which lucky for us had just gone on sale! The owners, Meyer and his son Maurice, were incredible to work with and very patient with us, since we went back three times before making a final decision. They were able to size it in a single day so I wore my gorgeous new ring the next day. I also should say that beyond the classic and contemporary styles, they had some fabulous show-piece type jewelry that was out of our price range but really fun to view up close.
