Both of my parent are very ill and just a few diagnostic imaging referrals would have found the problem with my parents. They never pick up the phone. The diagnostic facility faxed reports of the results to two fax numbers given by the staff but when I called today the clinic coordinator said they haven’t received any information. I believe Dr. Pena doesn’t work there any more which might be the best thing for that practice. I will definitely be reaching out to the medical board about the physician and facility.  Growing up in Washington Heights we figure our Latinos doctors would take better care of their community but it’s sad that’s not the case.
