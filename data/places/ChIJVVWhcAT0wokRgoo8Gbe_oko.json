Right away, she understood what type of property I was looking for (a one-bedroom apartment uptown in a co-op building at a reasonable price). She brought me to a different apartment on the same day in Washington Heights. Very soon, and thanks to Simonne’s great advice, I made an offer on this very apartment, and it was accepted!\n\nThroughout the entire process (getting a mortgage, finding an attorney, interviewing with the co-op, etc.), Simonne accompanied me with kindness and professionalism. She knew I was completely new to this, and she was so generous with her time. No question was too silly for her.\n\nSimonne was always extremely responsive (by text message, calls, and emails), helpful, and positive (which is really needed during such a stressful process). She also knows everyone in the real estate world and connected me to all the right people (attorney, bank, etc.).\n\nI could never have done it without her. She basically helped me realize a dream. If I ever decide to sell or purchase a place again, I know that Simonne will be the one. I’ve already recommended her to all my network. She’s not only a great professional but also a fantastic person."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’m currently writing this review from the apartment I just bought, thanks to Simonne Hill.
