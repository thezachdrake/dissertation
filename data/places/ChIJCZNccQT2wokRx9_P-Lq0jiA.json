The last straw for me with this store was when I went to the store and they took my 8 years old sons book bag. And I was completely fine with this because it's the rule. However when I fully stepped into the store I was surprised to see a grown woman with a large book bag on her back, and two other children with book bags on their backs, in the store. When I mentioned it to the guy that works there he wouldn't acknowledge my point, and kept asking me am I done shopping, and when I'm done I will get my son's books bag back. I got a sense that he was irritated with me mentioning this. I just thought it was weird and unprofessional to not enforce the rule for everyone. So I left without purchasing anything from there. I already started shopping online mostly to save money because of their prices but after this I realized I need to just completely avoid this store cuz there are better alternatives out there. So for household products I will go locally to dollar tree or CVS and for groceries I shop online on Amazon fresh and that has been a better experience for me.
