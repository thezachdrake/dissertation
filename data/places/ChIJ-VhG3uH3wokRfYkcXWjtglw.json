First off, the yellow curry flavor was not noticeable at all, so I'm not really sure why they’re called “yellow curry” nachos. They tasted like pretty standard restaurant nachos, with chips + cheese sauce + shredded chicken. It wasn’t really bad, but it was overwhelming. There is a ton of cheese sauce on top, to the point where it was a bit off-putting. We enjoyed it for a few minutes but stopped as we knew we’d get sick.\n\nThe Thai Basil Stir Fry was mediocre. Standard white rice. A few pieces of chicken. Weird-tasting pickled carrots. Lots of ginger. A side serving of nuts. It’s okay if you’re super hungry and need to eat anything, but not okay if you’re looking for a good quality entree for $15.\n\nThe brownie was, again, okay. Standard brownie, although it tasted a bit off, to be honest. Waaaaay too much whipped cream on top. Tasty scoop of vanilla on the side. But there were also blueberries alongside the brownie, which is something I’ve never seen before. Strange.\n\nFor all these dishes, we left them unfinished as we couldn’t be bothered to eat anymore after a certain point.\n\nThe service was questionable. The servers were nice, but the weird thing is they kept coming to our table about every 5 minutes or so, asking us if we were done eating. If we put our utensils down for a second to take a break from eating, they’d teleport to us asking if they could take our plates or not. It felt like we were certainly being rushed - strange given that it wasn’t fully packed or anything. Not great.\n\nDo note that it can get pretty loud inside - it is a pub, after all. If you’re looking for a quiet evening, it isn’t here.\n\nOverall, this place might be good as a pub, but as a restaurant, it leaves a lot to be desired."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"2/5: A gastropub with questionable gastronomy and weird (negative) quirks\n\nI’m reviewing this place as a restaurant, not a pub, as I didn’t have a drink.\n\nCame here with my date on a Sunday night to have some plates for dinner.\n\nWe ordered the Thai Yellow Curry Nachos, Thai Basil Stir Fry, and then the Chocolate Brownie.\n\nThe Nachos were certainly… interesting.
