Wow! It s great!\n\nFurther more my hair looked great! I used this service twice already and had to share the experience. Just found it ongoogle when i lost her number and had to review it when i saw no feedback people need to know about this incredible service.\n\nThe first time i did this i ept my braids for 7 weeks before taking it out.  Then called her again and had even better experience as i was napping for 5 hrs while she braided me. Lol. It took less time than i usually get for that same style and no pain. Its amazing! I use to wait for hours just to get the braider to touch my hair. She deserve the novel price for braiding revolution.\n\nAll my life i had been crying while getting braids and for the first time i was smiling, relaxing and even sleeping 😄. I couldn't believe it. I recommend this service.
