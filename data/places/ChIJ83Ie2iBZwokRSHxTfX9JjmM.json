I've been undecided whether to comment or not, but I think it's always better not to stay silent.\n\nA few months ago (September 10 of last year if I remember correctly), I was in NYC. I had gone with my husband to some sessions at the UN on Human Rights and family issues. As I dealt with these issues, as well as gender and equality issues, I couldn't feel nothing for what happened.\n\nWhat I will comment for many will be something insignificant. For others, it may take some discomfort and it would be logical when touching on a sensitive subject such as respect and non-discrimination.\n\nWalking the day before our departure in Bleecker and discussing with my husband about the issues discussed there, we passed this store. It caught my attention to go. We were on the other side of the street and I told my partner: come with me. We cross the street. As we crossed, a woman inside the store was walking towards the door (I thought she would kindly come to receive us) and when my husband and I were in front of the door, we saw and heard how the woman had put the lock/key on the door and she crossed her arms. Inside, another young man was sitting and saw the situation and just stared at it without doing anything. I was shocked.\n\nMy husband and I had a few seconds of silence. We decided to go. After the awkward moment, we did not know whether to notify our relatives and known institutions about the treatment in this store. We let it go temporarily. For now, this is the message I would like to leave to anyone who reads it:\n\nThe place is externally good and the products look of good quality. It is the people who serve who sadly did not have human qualities. People who stand out to the establishment not for its customer service, but for its selectivity in the clientele.\n\nBeing honest, it is a store that does not make you want to return like others where the attention, service and treatment are splendid. What makes a place of quality is that, not prices, nationality or skin color.\n\nNow, why do I telling this now? It seems to me that it is never too late to point out and contribute something. I dedicate myself to human rights issues. I have been a civil servant in my country and I always put the person at the center. I can deal with this, but there are a lot of people out there who can't, it affects you and can cause you serious mental health injuries when it's not your fault. When the complexes are one of those who exercise this type of psychological violence through discrimination. As what I am and what I have been trained in, I feel obliged to speak about it and put on the table absurd events that continue to happen day by day and without any conscience.\n\nI don't expect any apology. Not a good deal either because I'm not going back (at least nota for buy). I just hope that no one else from now on has a hard time at this establishment, and that this establishment make people proud and not disappointed in purchasing their products. That is what will define them at the end of everything.
