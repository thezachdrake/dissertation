Always working delicately to make sure I was comfortable but also making sure that I keep the muscles  loose and strengthened as much as possible. She was very knowledgeable about the work that was done to my shoulder and bicep and kept me well informed of what motions I should and should not be performing during my recovery. She kept me updated with exercises I was to perform daily at home or in the gym to help strengthen the muscles as I began to recover. At my doctor's visits  I always showed great progress, and he always marveled at how quickly I was recovering visit to visit. This was of course because I followed Kim's instructions and was diligent about performing my exercises. They were tough to perform at first as the repaired muscles were weak from lack of use, but I always felt better afterwards. If I did not exercise I would feel them stiffen up.\n\nAfter my last visit in January I started to get back to my old lifting and cardio routines, with the knowledge (from Kim) that I am nearing forty and have to pay attention to my form and posture now more than ever.A year after surgery my strength is almost back to were it was before the injury. I can thank her today that I can hold my baby son comfortably and safely thanks to the work Kim did to get my shoulder back into shape.
