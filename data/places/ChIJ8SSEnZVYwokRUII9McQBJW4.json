He has suffered from chronic sinus infections and constant congestion for most of his life.   He had terrible debilitating headaches which were affecting his school work.  His other symptoms included constant yellow-green discharge, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough which was keeping him up at night, and hoarseness.  His symptoms would calm down with antibiotics and then flare up when he would go off.   He couldn’t concentrate because of the headaches and cough and his schoolwork was suffering.  We’ve tried so many doctors and allergists, but nothing was working.   He was taking so many different medications.  His sinuses were affecting his daily life at home and at school. He was not himself for years.  At one point, we were told that his only hope for relief would be a major surgery.  Then someone recommended Dr. Jordan Josephson to us as an alternative to the doctors that we were seeing in our hometown.   Dr. Josephson was highly recommended and after seeing him on the first appointment, we left the office feeling as if we have just found our solution to all our son’s congestion issues.  He gave us hope.  Dr. Josephson came up with a course of treatment, arranged for appointments with associates and set us up with an Allergist – all in the same day.  He explained that we needed to take a longer course of medicines which no one before told us.  Months of medicines he said, we would need to be patient and that if we were he would most likely not need surgery.  Who ever heard of a surgeon forgoing surgery.  Well, exactly what Dr Josephson said would happen, happened.  Dominick is now off all of the previous medication he was taking except for a nasal spray.  He is still irrigating with a Grossan Hydropulse and salt water.  Dominick’s headaches are gone.  And he is not coughing anymore.  The improvement is a miracle.   He has started weekly allergy shots for allergies that we didn’t know he had.  And NO Surgery.  We were able to treat his symptoms without having him undergo surgery because Dr. Josephson took the time to treat him with effective medicine and saline rinses.  We were elated to find a surgeon that advocated for us and got us to take a longer course of medicine to obviate the need for surgery.  For the first time in my son’s life, he is feeling better than he has ever felt and as a parent there is no other goal in life.  Dr. Josephson, we are grateful to your staff!! Your staff has been very caring and helpful through this very trying time.  Your colleagues that you sent us gave us VIP treatment and were wonderful.  And most important, thank you, Dr. Josephson, for the wonderful care that you have provided, the time that you spent above and beyond to allay our concerns,  and for getting us to give Dominick the medicines allowing us to forego surgery.  Our son is once again happy and healthy thanks to you."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have a 12-year-old son named Dominick, who has been debilitated by his sinus problems.
