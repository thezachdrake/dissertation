My daughter started here at 4 months and stayed for a total of 5 1/2 months and i must say we both loved this place. From day one of bringing my daughter here she adapted pretty quickly and took to the caregivers naturally. She didn't cry at all i was actually the one crying (first time moms will understand). Her first day went so well, i was thoroughly pleased. She was the youngest baby there during her time there but she was well paid attention to and well taken care of. This place is clean, well run, and staff is very attentive and dedicated to the development of all the children. Communication with the parents was great and they did a lot of fun and educational activities with the kids.
