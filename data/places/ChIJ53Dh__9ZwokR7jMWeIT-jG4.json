The lines at the pharmacy are wild too. 20-30 minutes at busy times and the pick up line can’t help with unexpected issues. They can’t see the issue, just that they can’t help you and you can’t get your meds. They point you to the line to speak with the pharmacist, which can be another 20+ minute wait.
