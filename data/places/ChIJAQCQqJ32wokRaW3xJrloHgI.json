They do not tell you the price over the phone so when the technician arrives it is astronomically expensive.

I tried to get my money back and the employees were extremely rude and unhelpful and hung up on me. NEVER EVER USE THESE PEOPLE. They are con artists and I am probably only 1 of the many they have scammed. I suggest using someone who has better reviews and tells you the actual price before the job is done and you end up paying more to remove the AC than the actual cost of the AC."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the most trash experience I have ever come across.
