We were excited by the Mandarin immersion opportunity.  We've stuck with the school through its growing pains because our kids have gotten a great education so far, and both are verbally fluent in Mandarin and are reading and writing Mandarin (as well as English; our older one is an avid reader in English).  Some parents have griped about certain administrative issues - although we think the school is on more stable footing now - but we think that through it all, the school has consistently kept the academic curriculum its top priority, always thoughtfully seeking best practices in education as well as immersion education.

Yes, there has been teacher turnover in the past, but the reasons that I'm aware of for many of them are largely beyond an administration's control and come with the territory of native-speaking Chinese, mostly young and talented, sought-after teachers.
