I’ve followed her instructions to the exact last detail (not that much detail is provided given the short length of the time spent with the patient) and it only made the problem worse.

Not that it mattered – because both approaches would have made my medical issue considerably worse.\nI then went to a follow-up visit only for the doctor to tell me that my medical issue has improved, which was a bold and false thing to say given that I can see clear evidence to the contrary. I don’t need to be a medical professional to know that my skin condition has gotten worse. Then, of course, the doctor tells me I used the medication incorrectly despite using it exactly the way I was told.
