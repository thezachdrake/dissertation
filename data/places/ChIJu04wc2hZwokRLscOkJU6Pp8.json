Very thing was super cleaned and looked exactly like in the pictures. This does accommodate up to 3 people only. Location is also the biggest asset to this apartment. You are literally 2 blocks away from Times Square and walking distance to the theatres, shopping and many restaurants in the area. We felt very safe even walking late evening/ early morning.
