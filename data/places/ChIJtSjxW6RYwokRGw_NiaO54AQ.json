Deleting the truth and lying to the public, as if these tragedies haven't occurred, reflects what a poor and shameful business this is, to say the very least.\n\nMy experience: I grew up on the Upper East Side; my parents still reside there and it's a neighborhood where I have always felt safe. This is a privilege. That being said, due to this specific  \"establishment,\" I feel fear, to say the least, when traveling by. Despite recent news, the reputation of this store has long been as it is because of these unaddressed, fundamental issues that are actually, in fact, lethal; this is old news, and with all respect to those who have suffered recently at the expense of this \"business,\" I have nothing but sympathy and compassion because as I stated, this is all old news and these recent events should and could easily have been avoided.\n\nI have not directly interacted with the owner, Ms.Hudson, because I've genuinely been too afraid to even travel near her store, with or without my dogs, so I honestly cannot testify to the accounts of her rudeness or poor customer service. That being said, objectively speaking, choosing to have animals is any owner's commitment to caring for them--this owner, Ms.Hudson, has (supposedly had generations of) German Shepherds that have induced fear into anyone unfortunate enough to cross paths with them. Her negligence has resulted in tragedy and these tragedies have been met with more negligence... -- I purposefully avoid walking my dog and my parent's dogs on this block or anywhere near these beasts, as the owner clearly refuses to do what's right despite every tragedy that has transpired.  Whenever I have caught sight of these dogs, I myself have felt uneasy, and again, I've worked with animals because of my care for and desire to understand them! Only as a result of recent publicity and at the expense of innocent lives, has the owner supposedly taken any action. Regardless of whatever the owner may or may not be willing to do now, the damage and loss caused by Ms.Hudson's lack of care and her murderous gang of hounds is irreparable.\n\nNote: Having worked professionally in the animal industry, specifically with domesticated cats and dogs, I have experienced and believe that any dog can be trained with correct love and handling. On the contrary, Ms.Hudson is inattentive and ignorant, casually sitting by, witnessing the dogs she has inadequately cared for now demonize and terrorize the entire neighborhood. Furthermore, it is well known that German Shepherds are a breed of dog commonly used by the system and law enforcement due to their physical and mental capabilities. They are a breed that is characterized by their trainability, strength of mind, and brute force. They are predisposed to become aggressive if not properly cared for, as many breeds, especially larger dogs, tend to be.\n\nConclusion: How should our community be expected to respect or support you when you constantly (choose to) fail to see how your ignorance has affected, moreover, irreparably harmed, so many? If you've supposedly made efforts to train your dogs and make amends yet this abuse still occurs, why haven't you taken the initiative, as a dog and business owner, to remove these monsters from the premises? You will never be the victim in this context, especially when you choose to censor those who testify to your abuse by deleting their honest reviews. I am thankful to have been able to protect my own loved ones, human and four-legged. My love and condolences are extended to all the victims and their families."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"*12/6/23 UPDATE: THE BUSINESS IS *STILL* DELETING ALL NEGATIVE YELP REVIEWS**\n\n** LA LIBRAIRIE DES ENFANTS IS A DANGEROUS \"ESTABLISHMENT\" THAT HAS CONDONED VIOLENCE AND EVEN DEATH. ** (And they are currently DELETING customers' honest accounts to hide the truth!)\n\nIt is necessary to post this review here and now as, again, the business has deleted any recent negative reviews, though there have been multiple accounts of violence that have even led to death that have taken place here.
