In the next morning, I discovered myself paralyzed on the entire right side of my body with speech impairment and loss of memory. The doctor explained 6 spots of my brain was damaged by blood clot which was traveled from the hole in the heart created by the accident. I was in stroke condition. Besides, my external injuries were extremely severe. I had gone through surgeries 6 times. The entire femur bone and knee in the left side was replaced with titanium. My right thumb was so painful that I had to take Botox every 3 month to make it numb. The MD told me I must sit in the wheel chair for the rest of my life. However, I did not accept this sentence. I tried so hard to walk through physical therapy. Since 2 years after the accident, I started walking, but it was so limited that I mostly relied on wheel chair. I could not walk up the stairs and couldn’t walk more than 10 feet. I had received acupuncture treatment for 5 months in Manhattan before coming here. It helped me a little. Then I witnessed a remarkable recovery of a serious illness by Dr. Chung’s treatment from a Korean lady in my neighborhood. I decided to visit her. The dramatic changes started happening with her treatment. My right leg became strong. My trembling leg and arm become calmer. In 2 weeks, I was able to move my paralyzed, closed fingers in the right hand. I could open and close my fingers. In 4 weeks, I was able to move my paralyzed toes and raise my leg. I could have never done this motion before. In 8 weeks, I even walked up to 2nd floor. I am able to walk much longer than before. I can go to the bank by myself without wheel chair. All these activity were impossible for me before. In 8 weeks, I was able to grip things with the right hand. In 10 weeks, I even lifted my clutches and bags with my right hand. I am so enthusiastic about my progress. I am still going to the clinic anticipating more progress.
