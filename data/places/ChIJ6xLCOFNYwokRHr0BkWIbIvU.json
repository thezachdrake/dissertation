We arrive in on time. There is a bathroom that is stocked with toilet paper and sanitizer. My reason for 4 stars instead of five is, I was sick this week and canceled my travel plan. There’s not a system where you can get a credit, you have to commit to a future day. For me, it would’ve been a $10 switch fee, and since I am not sure when I’m going again I just ate the cost of the ticket. I couldn’t figure it out on the site (this was before I gave up on figuring out when I would be going next ) and relied on people picking up a phone that I’m guessing is manned by very few people. The person I finally got through to was very nice, but I’m talking 15+ attempts.  They did get back to me from the form I sent on the site, faster than the site said they would. So if anyone from the company reads this, my main critique is to make it easier to switch online, and have a system for credit, even if it expires in 6 months. Life is uncertain. I don’t want to pay an extra two dollars or whatever it is every time I’m planning my travel in case I’m sick.
