We do not get paid we just love to eat and have fun.  We really loved Dirty French.  Must get reservations but lots of tables.  Staff is excellent.  Great managers, hostesses and servers.  Pamela was our server, has been there since 2015 and knows the menus inside and out.  She gave us a ton of great ideas.  Started with the deviled eggs.  Just like grandma use to make with some fun spices.  All dishes here are a homage to their name so you can expect french flavors but with lots of different \"dirty\" spices and flavors blended in where you would not expect them.  They give you a giant flash fried bread dish with awesome onion dip style butter.  Yummy!!!  Then we had the famous mushroom millefeuille.  Think of 1,000 layers of noodles with the best corn sauce (with some hot spice in parts) but the noodles are a very subtle mushroom.  If I had told you it was potatoes with no mushrooms you would believe me because the mushroom flavor is very subtle.  THIS IS A MUST ORDER ITEM!!! I also had the in house sausage with in house mustard sauce.  Again the sauce was very complex and not what you would expect.  Fantastic.  For our mains I had their famous orange duck.  Only limited servings availabe each night so you must ask for it and hope it is not sold out.  Best duck I have ever had.  Moist, inside, cripsy outside.  Wonderful sauce (again note the \"dirty\" fun flavors in it) that only had a hint of orange.  I will get that every time I have the chance.  She had the hangar steak.  Be sure to order it medium rare to get the most flavor.  Very good sauces again and the fries are double or triple fried so very crispy.  I love the fries this way.  They are like the little ones at the bottom of the box of fries you get and they are exquisite.  For deseert we had the beignets that come with the famous sauce from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans or at least a \"dirty\" version of their sacue.  These are served hot out of the fryer and are to die for.  You cannot go wrong with this dessert.  You get 4 of them but do not split an order, they are too good to share!!!  Ask your servier about all the red roosters in the room and about the clown busts.  Very funny stories.  Look for the 3 frogs behind the bar and they will think you are a regular.  We had a great time with great food and great employees like Pamela.  We will come back again and look forward to many DIRTY nights again!!!!  Check out all of our reviews. If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic. Follow us if you like. We had over 36 million views so far this year and we thank you for that.
