My apportionment time was at 3pm so I arrived early - maybe around 2:45/2:50 pm because I don't like being late for appointments. When I walked in the assistant had me sit on the couch - at this point, he is doing one woman's hair and there is another waiting (First red flag). Around 3pm (when my appointment was supposed to begin) the assistant told me to go and wash my hands and when I returned to the couch there was another woman who was also waiting - she immediately went and washed her hands and was seated in a chair (second red flag). The woman who arrived after me, but was seated before, was then taken to have her hair washed. I was not put into a booth chair until about 3:15pm and around 3:25pm I was then taken to have my hair washed by the assistant (third red flag). When I returned to my seat the assistant then was the one who blow-dried my hair (I know this can be normal at some salons but I have never had this happen at my normal salon - I am originally from DC but in NY for school - and the first time I came to Hair Rules last year). Additionally, when blow drying my hair the assistant commented on my heat damage - I always wear my hair straight because for ME it is the easiest to maintain due to my busy schedule and the frequency in which I workout - when I explained to her the reason why she understood and dropped the conversation.\n\nAt 3:48pm I was FINALLY seated in Dickey's chair, by this point I am very annoyed because I have been waiting so long and I would assume for such a \"professional hair stylist\" he wouldn't triple book himself. When he starts flat ironing my hair he made two comments about my heat damage and when I explained to him the reason why he then made another comment - which was unnecessary and rude at that point. He then asked when is the last time I got my hair cut. I told him the last time I got a haircut was over the summer and a trim in December he made the most disgusted face in the mirror as if my ends are just horrible - and if that was the case then perhaps as a hair stylist he would tell me that he is going to trim it and just charge me ESPECIALLY since his whole brand is focused on his notion of healthy hair. When he was finally done with my hair it looked nice - but like I could have done it myself. When I booked my appointment the price stated online was $125 - and since it is cash only (for whatever reason since he accepts cards for his hair products) I had $145, because I initially planned on tipping before. When I went to pay with the assistant she told me it was $150 and when I told her it was only listed as $125 online she went online and saw that it is listed as $125 she could not explain where the additional cost was coming from. I had to use the ATM in the salon to take out $20, because I was overgoing back in forth with the woman - paid the $150 and left. I will never be returning again, which is unfortunate because I was truly happy with how my hair looked last year when I went but in hindsight, I was only happy because it had the highlights and the haircut that my real stylist gave me a few months before coming to Dickey."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This was my second time visiting the salon, the first was last year around the same time as this.
