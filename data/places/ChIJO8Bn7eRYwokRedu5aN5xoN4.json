He is a good dentist who cares for his patients. However I can’t always say the same about his front desk staff. It’s been a mixed bag over the years. Most recently I had a regularly scheduled cleaning. My job had changed insurance providers. My wife had no issues at her dentist: they made a 1 minute phone call to verify her new provider and took care of her right away. No issues and no concerns. However, when I got to Dr Ayoubi’s office the receptionist first gave me hell for not communicating the change in providers - as if I didn’t have other things to worry about - and then refused to let me in arguing that they need a roster file from the provider and since I’m not in it they cannot see me. I calmly explained all she needed to do is call the provider the way my wife’s dentist did. She said they don’t do that. Only roster file, 100% inflexible. I explained I know the doctor, being that I’ve been coming to the office for almost 2 decades. I politely asked to let me speak with him. I explained I took a 2 hour train ride from Long Island explicitly for this visit, and took time off work. Nope. She refused to let me in or speak with the doctor. Frustrated, sad and a bit defeated I headed back to Penn station. Guess who is joining my wife’s dentist practice :). Good by Dr Ayoubi, I will be sad to go after so many years. But ultimately it’s your practice, your staff and your rules."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve been a patient of Dr Ayoubi’s for nearly 20 years.
