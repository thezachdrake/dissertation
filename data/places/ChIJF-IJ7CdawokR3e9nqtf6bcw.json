Almost seven years ago John and Janet designed my engagement ring. My now husband had a simple design in mind that involved various small diamonds in a celestial pattern on a thin band. We went to the diamond district first where the jewelers scoffed at us saying don't waste our time. We randomly found John and Janet because their store looked different than the rest - warm and inviting and photos of smiling people adorning the walls. Janet heard us out and gently explained that the small diamonds that we wanted were not even graded which is the profit motive for many jewelers. She wasn't deterred, was charmed by our love story and helped us design the exact ring that we wanted. We never felt rushed and would often see repeat customers dropping by for custom jewelry, gifts for birthdays, christenings, push presents, etc. I wanted a phrase from a Robert Burns poem hand engraved on the inside my husband's wedding band. They found an expert who did an amazing job. I chose a plain micro pave wedding band to match my ring. To this day people compliment and ask me about my engagement ring to due to its unusual simple design. Fast forward to today...we have an energetic 11 month old and another on the way. I lost my wedding band so we went back to J Sampieri to get a replacement. The moment we walked in the door John gave us a big smile and asked a very specific question that showed that he remembered us from all those years ago. We placed the order for the ring and a short week later I found my wedding band. Since we are expecting another baby we're bit more stressed about finances these days and when I called John up to cancel the order he was very understanding and kindly sent me a check right away.
