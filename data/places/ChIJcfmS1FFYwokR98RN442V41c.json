I reserved a guest room with one queen bed as the location is ideal to the Salsa Socials I attend on Sunday nights close to the hotel. The hotel is immaculate, great front desk staff and quick response to any technical issues you may have with a guest room. The room is not roomy, but is was really great as a no frills place just to rest my head for a night. My room on the 11th floor even had a view of the city and partial view of the Hudson River.  They have a great first floor area for sitting and they have a really great full service self serve breakfast in the mornings. Breakfast is included as part of your stay!! Breakfast was great and the place was buzzing with guests speaking in many different languages. I stuffed my face at breakfast!! Bring a magnifying mirror if you need to do makeup and the closet space is not that roomy but serves the purpose for the night. The room has a small refrigerator  and coffee maker and coffee and tea bags. At night there is a snack area on the first floor in case you get the munchies where you can buy chips, ice cream and snacks.  I paid $117.00 which is a steal in NYC. They will add a $50.00 deposit upon checking in which will be refunded to you down the road. It's within walking distance to the Intrepid Air and Space museum and the west side waterfront.  It's relatively close to the 42 Street area, within walking distance. The bathroom hair and face wash products are DOVE brand which is great. I will be using this hotel when I go to my Sunday night salsa socials then crash at my guest room. Great deal!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my one night stay at the Holiday Inn Express Manhattan Midtown West Hotel.
