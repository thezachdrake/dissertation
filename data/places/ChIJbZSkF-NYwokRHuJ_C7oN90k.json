I so wish I had read through these reviews first!  They are spot on and very much reflect the experience I had as well when I attempted to have a physical with Dr. Pate a few weeks ago.  She seems like a warm and well intentioned person, but the delivery of services is just awful.  First, I was very clear in my booking that I wanted to see her and not her nurse or assistant, as I have some background medical issues I wanted to talk to her about.  Despite confirming my appointment repeatedly and being kept waiting a good while, my visit was essentially only with her assistant — that made me very frustrated and upset.  With no disrespect to the assistant, if I wanted to see you, I’d book with you.  The assistant was also very determined to push extensive cardiology screening despite my telling her that I had my own cardiologist, had just had an extensive cardiology workup elsewhere, and that I would follow up with my own specialist if needed.  She bristled at this, and said I had no choice but to “at least” have an ekg — which was done, after another lengthy wait, by a nurse who didn’t seem confident in how to do the procedure?  I was also told the result was abnormal — very alarmist and I have reason to think that wasn’t actually true — i asked to get a copy of their ekg readout and noone would get back to me, so hard to know...  The entire vibe with the assistant was tense and unpleasant — perhaps compounded by the fact that she wasn’t the person I booked the appointment to see?  Dr. Pate came in after I had been in the office for about an hour and a half — I was insanely hungry and thirsty and frustrated at that point — she too seemed to want to talk about cardiology issues rather than just telling me to follow up with my own cardiologist.  There was no time to ask her about all the issues I DID come to see her about, and when I asked she said, “why don’t you make an appointment to come see me?”  I was speechless, I was so angry.  Why did she think I was there???\n\nI requested a vaccination and explained to the assistant why it was a good idea for me to have it — forgot to tell her about checking preservatives so I was given one with preservative in it and had a bad reaction the next day — I’ll take responsibility for that since I guess I was supposed to be managing that?\n\nI had some high bloodtest results that were posted on line within a few days — noone from the office ever called me.  They had told me the procedure is to book and pay for ANOTHER appointment to come in and go over results if you want to see the doctor, and that THEN I would get to see her and not her assistant.
