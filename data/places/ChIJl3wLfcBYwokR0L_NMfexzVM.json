I honestly don't even think they write things down, let alone keep track of the issues tenants call about. My old building (but Glenwood is too cheap or lazy to add a system like this) had a ticket system like websites do, where an issue is logged and assigned to someone, so the tenant can see when it's completed and comment.

If you have an issue with a neighbor, even if they're breaking the law, they tell you to call the cops or, basically, shut up. They will not help you, and there's nobody to complain to about the service you get, because the owners of Glenwood care so little about their tenants that they made sure it's impossible to find out who they are (go ahead - dig around on the web -- they are invisible), let alone how to contact them. Therefore, no accountability. Therefore, no improvement in service.\n\n5. The workers in the building simply don't show up when you have an appointment, so you have to call on average three to six times, sometimes more, to get something fixed.\n\n6.

I had Time Warner AND Verizon Fios come over, and they both said that those were from the 1960's or thereabouts and have no use. In order to have cable you have to staple the cords along your ceiling. I asked my neighbors about this, and they said the same thing. He also told me that heat and AC is paid for by Glenwood -- that's a half-truth because they're electricity-powered and the tenant pays for electricity. My electrical bills, for a one-bedroom, are about $350/month.\n\n8. And this one is least important, but the heater/AC units are totally useless. They are basically either on or off, and you're either super hot or super cold. You can't adjust them properly like ones in newer buildings. Just like the pipes (which are regularly leaking and causing mold issues, or breaking and flooding apartments), the heating/AC units are from the 1960's and they don't seem to see a need to replace them.\n\nOh yeah, and I see that they're going to tell me to email that tenant services email.
