The location was breathtakingly beautiful, and the seclusion and privacy of the retreat made it feel like a sanctuary away from the outside world.\n\nThe “Grief Warrior” herself was unlike anyone I had ever met before. Her presence was soothing and powerful, and I knew immediately that I was in good hands. The modalities and healing energy she offered were unlike anything I had ever experienced. It felt like she was tapping into something beyond this world - something truly magical.\n\nDuring our time together, we explored my grief in ways I never thought possible. She helped me to uncover hidden emotions and beliefs that were holding me back from moving forward. Through a series of her 7 Stages of Grief and conversations, I was able to gain a new perspective on my loss and find a sense of peace that I never thought was possible.\n\nThe most profound shift for me came from how I felt about raising my small children. Before the retreat, I was overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty about how to move forward as a single parent. But she supported me - gibing me that added motherhood courage and purpose, even in the face of such immense loss.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend her 1:1 retreats. It's a truly unique and transformative experience that I will cherish for the rest of my life. If you're struggling with grief and looking for a way to find peace and healing, I can't recommend working with Mimi and a retreat enough."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"It's difficult to put into words the transformative experience I had on a 1:1 retreat with Mimi in an undisclosed location.
