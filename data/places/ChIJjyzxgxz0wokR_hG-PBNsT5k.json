I called the store again asking for the same model phone as the one that they damaged, I was told to give them a few days. After several calls and lots of back and forth with no one taking responsibility, I asked for my old phone to be returned instead of getting a refund. I’d rather take it elsewhere to get it properly fixed than deal with a business consistently trying to bury their very clear mistake.\n\nThe worst part of the experience is feeling like I was strung along because I did not speak Spanish.
