My concern was not only finding a competent surgeon but also a surgeon I could trust and within my budget. Calling these offices helped answer my questions and gave me a sense on how I should finance consultation fees. At Dr. Rapaport’s office, Samantha, advised me the costs would be non-refundable $500 for a breast augmentation consultation and that if I was to move forward, that $500 could be used toward my overall augmentation procedure. Samantha quoted the augmentation at $13-$15k. As a prospective patient, this was in line of my budget so I went ahead and booked the $500 non-refundable consultation. In my research, I have found this to be a common practice in plastic surgeon’s offices so nothing jumped out at me as odd.\n\nNow in hindsight I could have asked more questions but as a new patient, it should be the doctor’s office who should disclose all potential costs upfront. Similar to other plastic surgeons offices, Dr. Rapaport’s office provided me a cost range, therefore I trusted their professional representation of their services.\n\nIn person, Dr. Rapaport was wonderful to speak with, he answered all my questions and then some. I felt comfortable with him as my surgeon. He’s competent, experienced, and has wonderful bedside manners. However, at the end of my consultation, I was quoted for an underarm breast augmentation of $26k! This is nearly double the quote I was given over the phone via Samantha at Dr. Rapaport’s office! Not only did I find out after the fact, but I walked out extremely disappointed because I spent $500 on a non-refundable consultation for a doctor and procedure that I didn’t know I couldn’t afford. I can understand estimate ranges are still ballparks but should still be within 10-20%. I kindly asked for the $500 to be refunded and even offered to compromise for a partial refund. However, after multiple email and phone call attempts, I was told (although kindly) that any refund was not possible by the staff. I also have no way to confirm if they spoke with Dr. Rapaport directly on this matter either. Even if the staff unintentionally misguided me on the cost, at a minimum, the office should take responsibility of this error and aim to correct it. I did not feel this was attempted in the slightest.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rapaport is a highly intelligent and qualified surgeon for your plastic surgery needs, I must warn you of the staff. I cannot trust that the team is aware of his costs and even if they are then they should accurately guide a prospective patient of all potential costs before a non-refundable fee is paid. So I cannot trust that the team would be the best in my care, especially under anesthesia. Please look elsewhere for your plastic surgery needs. Not only should the surgeon be the best for your needs, financially within your budget, but the staff should also be the best in your care."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"As a prospective patient for breast augmentation, I called Dr. Rapaport’s office (along with several others) with questions such as ballpark costs for a breast augmentation.
