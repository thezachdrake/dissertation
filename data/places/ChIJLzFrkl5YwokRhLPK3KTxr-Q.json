We were taught at a very slow pace and the teachers did not know how to get the kids to behave so a lot of days were wasted. Also the lower grades were full of entitled rich kids who would throw a tantrum  whenever they did not get what they wanted. The principle had many events to try have some fun but those were futile attempts at trying to get the kids to like going to school at gateway (none of the kids liked it). Additionally the teachers are paid almost nothing for a private school in NYC and that's with the school asking for donations from all the parents constantly. Overall from my experience at The Gateway school it was a poorly run school that barely taught or prepared me or my peers for high school and beyond. Ps. if my grammar or spelling is bad that's just another testament to how little kids with get out of this school."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Went here from 5-8 grade it was alright. the teachers were alright but more than half of the teachers had left the school by the time i did.
