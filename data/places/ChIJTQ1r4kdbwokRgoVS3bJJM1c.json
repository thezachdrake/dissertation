The pools are vast, measuring 1 acre each, and are surrounded by bronze panels inscribed with the names of all the victims of the attacks, including those who died in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and on Flight 93.\n\nThe pools themselves are stunning works of art, designed by architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter Walker.

Visiting Ground Zero is a humbling and emotional experience, and the North and South Pools are an essential part of that experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Ground Zero in Manhattan and its North and South Pools are a must-see for anyone visiting New York City.
