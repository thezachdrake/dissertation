I also did my best to sleep before 12am and avoid cold fluids. Dr. Qin is really patient and attentive, asks questions before each session starts so he can properly assess the conditions. He has very extensive knowledge and will explain what he’s going to work on and I’ve learned a lot myself in terms of balancing my mind, body and paying attention to biofeedback.
