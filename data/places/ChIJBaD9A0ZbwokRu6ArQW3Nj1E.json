The porterhouse was very lean, too rare and a bit bland for my taste. My companion stated that it was dry aged, but he would have much rather seen the steak prior because it was giving CHOICE steak. I expected juicy, buttery, tenderness and more marbling than the one we received. We decided to go with meals that we could share. The other dish that we had in mind was the veal chop. A bit more seasoning incorporated would enhance the flavors of the dishes.\n\nThe ambiance was very pleasing and reminded me of an old school Italian mob movie.
