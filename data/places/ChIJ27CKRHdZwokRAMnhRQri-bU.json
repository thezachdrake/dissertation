My friend got “Rosemary” which based on the description we expected and wanted a more rosemary forward flavor. It was a solid drink but heavy on the gooseberry vinegar flavor. It was a little off putting at first but got better once it settled into the drink. I got the black sesame which I really enjoyed but still cannot describe the flavor profile it was so different. Definitely smoky, spicy and almost milky. Before we left our bartender made us a quick sample of a drink we wanted on the old menu “jalapeño” and it was strange and phenomenal.
