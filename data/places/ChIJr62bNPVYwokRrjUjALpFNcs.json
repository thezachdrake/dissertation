I have NEVER seen filth or mismanagement on the level I've seen since rejoining the Sports Club in 2023.\n\nThe locker rooms are filthy and unstaffed. Previously there was always one person upstairs and another 2 downstairs during busy hours. Now maybe there is one person for 3 floors. There are always dirty towels everywhere. On one occasion, a dirty pair of underwear was on the floor for at least an hour, another a large, dead cockroach lying by the jacuzzi. The hairdryers are so weak they couldn't blow out a candle. Several hairdryers have been \"out-of-service\" for months as has at least one shower.\n\nThen, there was the day TWO MONTHS ago when I opened a shower door to discover dirty takeout containers, utensils  and towels in the stall. The same day dirty, wet towels were also all around the locker, steam room and sauna. I complained to the front desk and in writing to management. Still waiting to hear back.\n\nI've emailed the GM multiple times with NO response other than a AGM thanking me for \"policing the locker room since he can't\". Wait, they have no female employees able to enter the locker room to see it's filthy and lacking towels??? Are they unaware that they have nobody staffing the locker rooms.\n\nThere are also frequently people in the spa area who are clearly not members (you can tell because they have all their belongings including their purses and phones nearby and sleep on the lounge chairs). This in addition to people talking on speakerphone in the locker room. Of course there are no attendants to tell them that phones are a no-no in the locker room and spa.\n\nThe club's hours were so truncated Thanksgiving weekend that it was impossible to get to the gym for a workout. This was unlike every other gym in the city that had holiday hours on Thanksgiving and normal ones the rest of the weekend. When I arrived, the locker room was filthy, there were no towels, dirty/wet towels were everywhere including the steam room, sauna, benches in locker room. The lifeguard (is he even a certified lifeguard?) was unaware that since the club closed at 4, the pool would be closed a half hour earlier and offered me a lane reservation at 3:30 (when the pool would be closed). I gave up and went home since without towels, I couldn't even take a shower.\n\nIf this were a one-time issue, I'd be upset, but it's ongoing. I rejoined because I had fond memories of the well-kept facility, loved the classes and instructors and was able to swim. That is a distant memory.\n\nNow there are significantly fewer classes, they aren't consistent (no more same class, same instructor 2 or 3x/week at the same time) and none in the afternoon (in ye olde days there was at least a mid-afternoon yoga class). The classes aren't very good and don't create the community that I enjoyed previously as a member. The few that are worth taking fill up within 2 minutes of opening in the app.\n\nWhen I told an instructor that I was just getting back in shape after an illness and asked if I needed a mat, she nastily replied \"only if you need it for emotional support.\" Another class had truly awful sped-up muzak. When I asked about it, the instructor said she doesn't listen to it, only picks out playlists that have the right beat.\n\nA terrible experience. Wildly expensive ($350/month).
