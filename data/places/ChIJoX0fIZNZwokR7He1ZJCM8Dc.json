This entire writing is simply from my heart.  Here we go!\n\nUpon reaching Cherry Lane Theatre, my first thought was \"It's very small\" however my reason for being there was BIG.\nThe only time I've gone to a play was either due to being in it myself, or going for someone else. So let me establish the background first.\n\n1. I'm a die hard Overwatch fan.  For those of you reading who have no clue what that is, the internet is your friend.\n2. Lucie Pohl was performing. She is very closely associated with reason 1; and is the reason I went to the theatre.\n\nThe establishment is located on an end street but in a comfortably friendly area of Manhattan.\n\nThe theatre itself on the inside is comprised of two parts. The first is a decent and cozy sized waiting area.  The theatre itself is tiny, off-Broadway appropriate with about 20-30 seats maybe. These are simple steel frame, cushioned throw chairs.  However this enables a production to get very intimate with its audience.\n\nSo I digressed.  I play Overwatch and Main (frequently play) Mercy.  Lucie Pohl is the voice actress for Mercy.  Get where I'm going?\nAnyway the stage was set up for the production and Anjali Bhimani (voice actress for Symmetra in aforementioned game) is also in attendance.  The night was off to a wonderful start.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the wonderful actress, (I am terribly shy when it comes to meeting people I look up to) we are set to watch Lucie Pohl perform.\n\nFor a solo woman act that lasts over an hour, there was never a point where I felt I needed to stretch and get comfortable or feel bored.  Every second of Pohl's performance was captivating.  The house did a fantastic job of lighting, music cues and sound.\nPohl herself was able to keep you smiling the entire time, bringing small but welcomed interaction with us and having a great time with her storytelling show. Her many voices, character interactions including ups and down within her timeline enticed you to know the next detail.  And hard won tense moments were broken beautifully by comically curveballs.\nThere were few times that you didn't think you knew the next task or occurrence which was important for me because I tend to pick apart movies instantly and know what's going on. Pohl was easily able to keep that curiosity going the entire time.  Seriously, If you can see her show at some point... Do IT!\nAll in all I can justify my feelings of empowerment in the arts through Pohl's actions.  Finding myself smiling after the show led to a brief and emphatically friendly photo op that caused me to spontaneously have a shirt signed (Thank You again Lucie for that!) and express my appreciation for both actresses in the short time they could gift to me.\nWhile both of my idols had plans for the night afterwards, I found myself thinking of what to write for this review once I got home.\nHonestly there is so much more I could say but unfortunately the review must stay somewhat focused on the location. However I can say that if Lucie Pohl does perform again at the Cherry Lane Theatre in the future, I am going to visit once more and enjoy the show again. in my vote, I put 5 stars. It really deserves 10/5 stars. Yes, that's 10 out of 5 stars.\n\nIf I can get a \"Teleporter Online\" so I can instantly get to the theatre next time, I'm 100% ready because this show's \"Hero will never die!\"\n\nFor reference, Pohl is on the left and Bhimani on the right in the group photo."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Let me begin by saying that this review is going to be very biased.\nI'm going to rant a little due to the circumstances which encouraged me to go to the location, and I have no formal theatrical review experience.
