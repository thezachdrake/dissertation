But lately, I have been experiencing disappointments.\nI paid over $350 for waist-length small Fulani braids in the front and knotless braids in the back. Unfortunately, the braids turned out uneven, with some being the correct small size and others medium-sized. My hair started coming out of the braids the very next day after I got them done.

She asked if I wanted her to stop and I told her I just wanted the size and color I wanted. She then told me that I was looking in the mirror while she was braiding and that if I kept looking in the mirror, she could stop if I wanted her too. It was passive-aggressive because why wouldn't I look to ensure I was getting what I wanted, especially with the first few braids being the wrong color and size? After I complained about the first braids not being what I requested, she finally stopped to mix the color but left the braids with the wrong color. It was a terrible experience to get what I booked an appointment for, and I had never had that issue before. The second time around, they did a terrible job, leaving even more of my own hair out of the braids, even though I had requested them to braid all my hair.\nSeveral people came into the shop to complain about braids falling apart within a day or two of installation. One customer was even told that she could not get the braids she wanted, and when she declined and requested a refund, they told her no because she did not send pictures of her hair in advance. She showed that she did email the pictures based on the required forms they send after booking, but still had to wait nearly 10 minutes for them to tell her they would process a refund in a week.\nAs someone who has been a loyal customer for over two years, I am disappointed with the recent quality of service."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have been a faithful customer of this hair braiding shop for more than two years, and I have always been satisfied with the quality of their work.
