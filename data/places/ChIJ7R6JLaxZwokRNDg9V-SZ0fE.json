He was detailed, thorough and overall excellent. He also always returned my calls and answered any questions I had within a day. Literally, within a day of getting MRI results I was on the phone with him, and he walked me through the results and what they mean for my treatment. At all times I feel like I know exactly what is happening, why and what are the next steps. As patient, this is extremely important and yet not to be taken for granted - it is not the experience I have had with other spine specialists in NYC. The staff at HSS is also fantastic and it helps that the HSS has their own immaging/radiology department that can get any x rays and MRIs done quickly. I also love that there is a user-friendly HSS app where a patient can see all doctor's notes from past consultations and tests, and schedule or modify any appointments. Well done. Five stars on all counts."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr Griffin is an excellent doctor: extremely smart and knowledgeable, attentive and patient-focused.
