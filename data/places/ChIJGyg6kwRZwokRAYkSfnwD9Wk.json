A general tip for homeowners planning on doing big construction job is to advise neighbors and warn vehicle owners of parking within the vicinity of the site - we did this, but it was not only too short notice, but the effort was inadequate (notes/signs/proper notification would have been more helpful in my case).\n\nHighly recommend this company for anyone searching for Roofing in the five boroughs.
