The presentation was authentic but it wasn’t up to par all around. The meat was well cooked and had excellent juicy flavor which had a charcoal fire roasted essence. The yorkshire was perfect.  The vegetables were fine and enjoyed the roasted garlic bowl on the dish. The offensive failure on this dish was the roasties. They were clearly cooked hours, if not a day earlier. They had ZERO crisp. They tasted reheated with a chewy soggy edge that made them difficult to cut. They were clearly old. They were inedible. It ruined the dish and really should never be served. We asked for english mustard which they had none but they did offer horseradish. English mustard is really an essential staple here. On the bright side, the bloody mary on the menu was the best i’ve ever had. The wine list was very pricey for even the most basic red. Sticky toffy pudding was tasty.
