The only turnoff was that the tool he used sprayed so much water onto my face that by the time I was done, my mascara smudged. I felt that when he was polishing my teeth last, it felt so rushed that when i spit my water out it was so red from the polish paste. Never happened before with me with my other dentist.

She takes it personally and there was an attitude. I told her that I didn't care about her attitude and if she could PLEASE tell the Dr to come out and look at my face. Attitude again and I said, I don't care about your attitude. She replies, You came in yelling at me. She goes to tell the Dr that I'm here evidently not because of my situation because when she came back she says, He said that he will see you after he sees his Patients. I said, Patients? I'll go find another Dentist. She says, Ok. Bye. Attitude! For those ppl who don't get it. When someone says, \"You\" then take it personal. Otherwise, it should be looked at because your in some kind of distress as how you would like to be treated. Luckily I'm not one to hold all of my eggs in one basket so I had also made an appointment with Dr. Gracias @ 143 Essex Street. I had a wait but not too long and when I had gone in the Assistant told me she needed to take an X-ray and that she will sit me back into the waiting area until the Dr was available. I couldn't open too wide because of the swelling on my face. She informed Dr Gracias and the Dr came in and gently said, But I need an X-ray. They did other measures and it was done. Perfect. The Dr didn't let the Assistant have me go back to the waiting room. She had the Assistant prepare the next room for me. She examined me and stated that the infection from my tooth was going into my eye. She prescribed antibiotics and that's all that I needed until the next step. Very compassionate.
