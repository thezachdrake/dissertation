I felt that I may have found my new lunch spot. However I was super disappointed. I ordered the chicken mozzarella melt and waited 25 minutes patiently, as I only had an hour lunch break, i went up to the register, and inquired about my order. When i inquired about my order the person at the register seemed annoyed. 5 minutes after she then came to speak to me to provide me an update. At that moment I learned that she was one of the managers. She informed me that my order was never put in, and the kitchen would be working on it. I then waited patiently for another 8 minutes. This was now a total of 38 minutes of my lunch hour wasted.  As the wait took so long I then decided to cancel my order and have it refunded to where I was advised by the same manager that the order would be coming out shortly. I was appalled at the fact that they denied me of opportunity of making it right and allow me to leave , as I asked to cancel the meal and have it refunded, instead yet again I got it will be out shortly. Never did I get an apology, the meal that I wanted to eat in the space, became a meal I had to eat as I was walking back to work, in order to avoid going over my lunch break.\nI was super disappointed as I waited over 40 minutes of my lunch hour for an open face sandwich. I truly feel this was a lack of customer service and I will not be recommending any of my colleagues to your space. I’m hoping that this email can serve as a training opportunity for  communication and guest interaction.
