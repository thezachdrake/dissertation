Obviously I couldn’t say no and I was shocked when I left. This was almost 10 years ago and my bite hasn’t been the same since. I can’t properly close my mouth anymore. All thanks to this wonderful office of crooks.\nI also find it fishy that his reviews only go back one year. What does that tell you when he's been around for ages?
