I’ve been to tons of yoga studios over the last 11 years. This is by far my favorite yoga studio I’ve practiced bikram yoga at. Great if you’re traveling. They’re very accommodating, they loaned me a lock, yoga towels, they have great showers with body wash, shampoo,conditioner, hair dryers and plenty of lockers and space to change. The drinks are not over priced like most studios. Check in is on the 3rd floor. I had a great check in experience with Cyan he was really kind, friendly and helpful. Bonus appreciation when he called me because I forgot some of my things. He’s a lovely person with the perfect personality for yogis. Mark Far’s evening 90 minute class was difficult but in a very good way. As a traveler he all warned me it’s hot. It’s a bit warmer temperature than the studios at home. Mark knew when to suggest encouraging to keep going and when to offer support when he saw me struggling. He’s kind, extremely knowledgeable with a really fun vibe. Lindsay’s 75 minutes morning class over looking Fifth Ave lovely she’s a vibe, totally fan girling over her. She’s also very kind, encouraging, knowledgeable with a fun vibe. Both instructors have amazing personalities. They both made me smile several times through my difficult journey. The students are as amazing and kind as the staff. They made me feel extremely welcome. I wish I had more time to practice with them. I wish I could bring this place home with me. If you’re new to this practice, or like me traveling in from out of town. Check in early, the trick is to get a spot by the window or door. Trust the processes and the instructors they know what they’re doing. This place is magical, I highly recommend coming here. I will be back on my future travels."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The best yoga studio I’ve been to.
