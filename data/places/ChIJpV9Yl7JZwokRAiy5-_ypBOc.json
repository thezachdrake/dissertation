Not sure if they're lacking a quality manager, or if the attendants just didn't get any education in their life and can't count how many cars they can let in while considering the amount of reservations they have.  Getting my money back was no easy task either.  They wanted proof that I had to park at a different location, pictures of bank transactions, pictures of the full sign outside of the garage(which there was none).  Do yourself a favor and park your car literally anywhere else in the city.  This place is run by idiots and if they have room for your car, they'll most definitely damage it."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Absolute worst parking location in NYC.
