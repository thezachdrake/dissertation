There was no place to go on that floor for daily reflections, peaceful meditation, or anything related to getting reground. Every where you went there were conversations about former drug use or explicit sexual encounters being glorified. I knew I was ready to stop what I was doing. I knew I didn't need to hear the sexual exploits because that definitely was my modus operandi. I wasn't proud of it anymore, because my own daughters had reached the age as the girls who were so happy to provide sexual favors for me, and that CUT INTO MY CONSCIOUSNESS. I left that horrid place, and yes, I did stumble ONE MORE TIME. After that I cried out to God. I call for a chaplain and\nI earnestly begged him for the strength to give UP BOTH ILLICIT Activities and I have not looked back.
