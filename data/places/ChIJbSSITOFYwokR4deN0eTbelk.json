I myself as a parent having gone through Montessori understand that the methodology is based on self-directed activity, hands-on learning, and collaborative play. If you have never tried or heard of Montessori I would recommend observing a class to see what you are getting into. Some parents might think the curriculum is too rigid, but it’s intention is to encourage every individual child to learn at their own pace and not necessarily the pace of an entire class. This might not be what is best for every child, but it is definitely what worked for me as a child and is very helpful for my daughter and our goals."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We had a great experience for our 5 year old.
