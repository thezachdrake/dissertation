She is not at all respected by other doctors and that is why she practices by herself.

She will also speak to the children planting false ideas in their head that they are being abused by the parents and encourages them to hide and withhold  information not only healthcare but in general from their parents again disguising her unethical practice as protecting child healthcare privacy however in truth she is breaking child parent trust and bond and creating problems in the family so she can feel like a hero.
