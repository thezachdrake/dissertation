You cannot go for one day and think that the hair will just go away. It does take time and work on your end. The work on your end would have to FOLLOW the rules! You can't use tweezers, wax, thread or pull any hair. This will SABOTAGE the process!!!! If you follow her rules and be consistent then you will get the results. If you don't follow the rules then you might as well throw money out the window. Each person is different meaning it could take months for the hair to be completely gone. This woman has changed my life for the better... The office is clean and quiet. Ronnie and her staff are very professional. Yes it is costly but at the end of the day, the office offers packages. And also the money is WELL SPENT!!!! Ronnie and her staff are very strict with time frames because they are running a business. So it is very important that you cancel within the time frames given. I do plan on telling friends and family. And I will be going back if I happen to get unwanted hair on another part of my body. Please make an appointment!! It will change your life...If you are worried about scars, the scars disappear over time. During the session you feel a little pinch. But it's not as painful as waxing or using a tweezers. The hair hasn't come back.. Time frame it took for me was close to a year. At first I had to go every other week or week.. Then soon after I started going once a month until the hair stop growing back..
