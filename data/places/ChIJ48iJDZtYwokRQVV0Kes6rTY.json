While it wasn’t noticeable to people, it bothered me, so I went to Dr. Pliakas for treatment. I thought he was going to recommend that the tooth be pulled, but instead he told me that he could completely realign my teeth using Invisalign.  I could not be more pleased with the results. He is a magician!  Over the course of a year-and-a-half, I used 42 clear plastic aligners to move my teeth into position and an additional 10 aligners to ensure that my teeth were perfectly straight. Upon finishing the treatment, I only need to use a retainer for a few more months on a daily basis and then just at night. The process was easy – I wore the aligners 24/7 except when eating, and changed them on a 1-2 week schedule as prescribed.  I had little to no discomfort, just a bit of sensitivity when eating on the first or second day of using a new aligner.  My speech was unaffected and no one knew I was wearing an aligner unless I told them. Invisalign is an amazing technology and Dr. Pliakas makes the experience easy and produces outstanding results.
