Nobody confirmed my appointment. I called the day before to confirm, and was told by his receptionist that the doctor only treats from the shoulder to the elbow. This does not appear on his webpage. Nobody called me to tell me this in the two weeks since I made the appointment. The receptionist refused to understand why I was so upset and just said the doctor wasn't responsible for what's on his page (yeah, still a problem) and wouldn't apologize for the fact that I wasted two weeks of my time, almost wasted my time by going in, and would now have to be in pain for a few more weeks until I can find another doctor. I realize I was upset, but the receptionist just made it worse by not acknowledging the issues and my poor treatment. Apparently she hasn't experienced constant pain. Highly inefficient office, to the point where it borders on inadvertent cruelty.
