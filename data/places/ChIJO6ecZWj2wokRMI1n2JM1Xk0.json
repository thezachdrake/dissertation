Luckily my daughter was accepted right away. She had the best kindergarten teacher in her last charter school. At the graduation day she asked me which new school my daughter would be attending  She was so happy when she knew it was Kipp Star. Surprisingly she was a teacher on Kipp Star and she told me everything she knows she learned from that school. She also said  that the school is very fun and academically exceptional. I couldn’t be more happier. My husband, my parents, my daughter and I went to the preview family meeting where we could meet the teachers staff and see the classrooms. We were so impressed by how the school organized the classrooms. Everything was connected for the kids learning in a fun way. Almost 2 months later I still impressed and very happy about my daughter being a Kipp Star student. My daughter loveee it. She cried when she had early dismissal day. She didn’t want to leave.
