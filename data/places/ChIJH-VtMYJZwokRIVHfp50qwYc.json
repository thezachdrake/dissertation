I forgot the owner of the restaurant's name but he's a Greek gentleman and I do use the word gentlemen. I never went inside until today. Nonetheless today I decide to sit down and have oatmeal and a big breakfast because I knew it had to carry me for the next 13 hours. I just finished my shift of 18 hours of work and yes I wasn't in the best looking condition I was a little shabby and just had to get some rest but that's no reason why I should have been treated the way I was treated by the waitress.  after taking my photos on the outside of this restaurant I have been longing to go to forever and I was approached by a short Latin man. Now my Spanish is okay but I had no idea what in the world he was saying. He did not have a menu in his hand he just approached me and said something I asked him to repeat what he said and he did again and I had no idea what he said. So I assume he was asking me do I want to take out or stay in so I said I want a seat. I sat and for some reason he disappeared towards the back of the restaurant. Mind you a tall black gentleman had came into the restaurant before me and he seemed to have had a day also as he was pretty much in the same attitude as I was we were both a little disheveled. LOL he had taken to seat no menu was given to him. however one would think you would greet someone with a menu when you come into a restaurant that causes you to wait to be seated. It was not crowded exactly five people were there. Looked around the restaurant before having a seat and began taking pictures of the counter and I was then approached by this tall woman, overly plump, with black hair who asked what do I need ?that was her statement to me Talk about professionalism where was it here?  Now I can see if she didn't speak English well but she did. Cuz one can interpret what do you need as how can I help you but she spoke English. She looked me up and down as though she was disgusted she then said can I help you? Mind you I'm standing over the table I'm about to sit down at I had pulled the chair to be seated. She then had the audacity to ask me again is there something you need? Now I'm irritated what the heck do you think I need was going on in my mind? So I told her I'm a customer may I have a menu? She then turned from me went and got a menu. I was so disgusted I don't even know if she bought me the menu but one was given to me . Those of you have been reading my reviews you know I have a thing for a clean bathroom. Yes it's been some years since this place has been here and yes some customers are not very nice in keeping the bathrm neat. as you see from the pictures it is a small bathroom with a cute little sink there are stickers on the door people have no respect for people property what a shame. The bathroom was not in the best of condition however I wash my hands came out made my order. My waitress  was a lady who brightened up my day her name was Marta. A short beautiful personality woman who took my order  told me how she liked the oatmeal that I was about to order and when it came I was delighted. It wasn't as creamy as I wanted to be but then again it didn't make a difference I was hungry and it did have a great texture. Having my fill of the oatmeal I then ordered a western omelette. The western omelet was still warm when it came to me I didn't like the hash browns they were hard scattered with some soft and the green peppers were not chopped up small enough. Nonetheless I enjoyed the omelette. I didn't want to complain because I had just finished the 18-hour shift and my main thing was to get food in me. Towards the end a group poor white people came in and they were immediately greeted with a menu at the door. Now you interpret this the way you wish. If the owner reads this please reach out to me perhaps you may need Marta to greet instead of the rude woman in the picture.
