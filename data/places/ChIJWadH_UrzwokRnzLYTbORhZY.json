Overall experience, I would just get dominoes next time."},"publishTime":"2023-12-22T18:07:49Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJWadH_UrzwokRnzLYTbORhZY/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURObDlQSm93RRAB","rating":5,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJxaAupB1tsNbsA0brJ4rjhN9f7h7O7s_B7AssyNFRg-w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108408036288145186636/reviews","displayName":"Maya"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My initial experience with this place wasn’t so great, as I think my pizza had little to no sauce on it and came cold.\n\nI’ve tried it a few times since then over the last year and I’ve had no problems with my orders.\n\nI’m just outside of Riverdale in Yonkers and whenever I DoorDash from here, my pizza always comes well-cooked and warm.
