Great visual style that the supposedly Mideastern food doesn't keep up with. Hummus had no garlic or lemon bite. We tried a good salmon curry, a large filet with a curried cream sauce. (curry, really?) The Salmon couscous (hoping for a tagine) was another fish filet with some plain couscous and steamed veggies on the side. The Lamb Kofte was a ground lamb patty with some rice and a few plain steamed veggies, but none of the dishes had the pizzazz or ethnic spice we were hoping for. No condiments to add either. So it has great ambience for a party but just so-so continental cuisine. Still, Salam is well priced for NYC, attractive and serves relatively large portions.
