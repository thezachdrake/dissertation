I admit that I was enticed by the affordable prices, but now understand that the higher prices you pay elsewhere are for a good reason, mainly training, quality of service, and quality of products. This salon lacked all these 3.\n\n1) training/safety: Unfortunately, right as they began installing the lashes, I realized that they were not following the protocol most lash places follow! They did not properly tape my eyes (they taped over my eyebrows which is bad!) and purposefully left them open. I was confused because one thing that is quite well known when it comes to getting lashes applied, is that your eyes must be closed entirely to avoid the fumes from the glue getting in your eyes. My bottom lashes were also not separated well using the jelly-like strips most places use. When they applied the first lashes, I realized they weren’t using a tweezer to separate my lashes, so nearby lashes kept getting glued together. This made it hard to open my eyes later! The glue they used also stung/itched, something I’ve never had to deal with before!\nIn addition this, they also advertised individual lashes, but were actually applying clusters/fans, so I’m worried about all the weight that’s been applied to my natural lashes since I’ve always only done individuals/not clusters.\n\nAfter doing my first eye in about 20 mins which was fast (realized later that it was because she was doing clusters and not individuals), she told me to open my eye, which I found super shocking because again, you’re supposed to keep your eyes closed to avoid the fumes from the glue! I couldn’t open my eye because her lack of technique meant that some top and bottom lashes were glued together, and she tried pulling them apart which was extremely painful, so I told her to just give up.\n\n2) professionalism: Before she started my second eye, she told me to wait 2 minutes, and I realized it was because she went to work on 2 other customers’ eyebrows! In the middle of my lash session with her!! 2 minutes then turned into 15 minutes, at which point I started complaining because it felt extremely unprofessional. She later came back to do my 2nd eye and apologized. When she finished, she told me to open my eye and check/let her know if I liked it, but because everything until then had been subpar, I just said “yes” because I wanted to just leave.\n\nResults: I asked her for a whispy but just slightly natural look and received *nothing* like it. Not even close! I also paid for hybrid when what I ended up getting was closer to a super natural/light look, so didn’t feel like it was fair for me to pay $80 for the hybrid price. My lashes weren’t EVEN (as pictured) which is really ludicrous if you think about it, because it’s literally their one job.\n\nI was waiting for a couple days to see how the lashes would hold up and it’s been disastrous already! Hasn’t been more than 3 days and I lost a cluster right in the center (as pictured), which is horrible considering that I should still have 3 weeks of wear on these!\n\nSidenote: They don’t have actual chairs dedicated to lash application, so you’re sitting on one of those hairdresser chairs with your head halfway off the head of the chair, and your back suspended for however long, which is very uncomfortable. I walked away with lower back pain after the session due to this.\n\nConclusion: I truly don’t recommend this place for lashes. These are people’s eyeballs we’re talking about. I feel like following proper training when it comes to that is paramount, unlike maybe other body parts like the eyebrows! I hope they invest in training and certification so that they can properly do lashes. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because they seem to do eyebrows and henna pretty well! Don’t come here for anything that requires proper safety measures and training (eyelashes, wax, facials)."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"TLDR: do not come here for lashes specifically!\n\nI went to Raj Eyebrow Spa this past week and had one of the worst lash experiences ever.
