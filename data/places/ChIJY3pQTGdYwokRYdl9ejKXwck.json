I googled and found Rental Instruments. And had few emails exchange with them and the overall rental process is pretty straightforward and simple.  When we got our first cello, my daughter didn’t quite like it and they were nice to allow us to swap and send over another cello. Return is easy by dropping off at a security desk at a residential apartment in NYC. I would recommend this place for anyone who would like to rent instruments while traveling to NYC.
