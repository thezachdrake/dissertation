All he kept telling me insensitively was how a line backer was back to his job already. I am a plumber not a football player. I have a family and a young daughter who relies on me putting food on the table and because I was still in pain and he had a massive ego he decided to impulsively write a report in my workers comp file that I was fine and should receive the minimum amount disability possible . How a guy who probably sits in a large house can do this to his patient who is addressing his pains and issues he’s still having is absolutely inhumane and atrocious. Find a better person to do your surgery, someone who will care and listen after the surgery is done and who actually has a conscience to not screw over his own patient in pain.
