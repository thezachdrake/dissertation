From my own personal experiences, they practice business just like any other business, prime example, Jewelry Stores.  My customer service is great with Sneaker Pawn and my son loves the store, it's called knowing how to work & communicate with people to get the best price. I've brought my son (13yrs) plenty of sneakers from Sneaker Pawn, all less than $120. I even brought my son a Gucci Suede track suit for his 13th birthday made by Dapper Dan.  Now where u going to find that! They will work with you on the price for sure, just ask. Not sure what selling experience is, so no comments there.  Sometimes you have to put the service in the customer....meaning provide them with the service of buying products from their store and become an avid shopper and then in return, I'm sure, you will get the customer service and the price you are looking for.
