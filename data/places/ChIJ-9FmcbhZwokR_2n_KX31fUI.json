I thought the uni may get lost with the other ingredients but it was perfect. The pork head BURST in your mouth and along with the silky tuna and uni was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten!\n\nNext we tried the percebes, or goose barnacles! They gave us a little lesson on how to eat them, which was so fun and inviting. As well as bibs and lemon water for cleaning fingers. They were so much fun to open, making a fine dining experience, feel playful. They were definitely “squirters”!The taste was mildly briny and sweet with and amazing tangy sauce.\n\nWe also had the kangaroo tartare, which has seemed to become their signature, and for good reason! It was delicious, unique and a generous portion! Everything here was a generous portion. Gamey but not too gamey and seasoned perfectly with interesting African spices. This was not at all trying to imitate a steak tartare and I loved the unquiness.\n\nWe also tried the quail with corn purée, with was so comforting! I appreciated the claw still on the bone! Beautiful plating. The Boar goat and eggplant was so rich, delicious and melt in your mouth! I’ve read someone say it was too much of the same texture but I couldn’t disagree more. It had a heap of cilantro on top to cut the richness and make it perfectly balanced. Desert was lovely as well! I also got to try some trendy orange wine and they had an extensive bottle list and excellent sommelier.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was so friendly and inviting. Everyone was talking and having a grand old time. They are famous for their whole fish, which I opted not to go for, as I was seeking out ingredients not served at many restaurants. But the people next to us did and it smelled incredible!\n\nI find this passion project so interesting and all the press has been fun to keep up with. You really get the sense that they are not trying to please any investors, owners or critics. It allows for a freedom and risks with the food that really comes across. I believe the will be up for some awards this year! The counter was fantastic, but there were also tables for larger parties. That is if you can get more than one person to come try this unique food with you! I would say this restaurant is only for the adventurous eater, but should you take that adventure you will find yourself with a wonderful experience. Thank you Foxface for existing!
