The Law Offices of Michael S. Lamonsoff was my answer. Our very first meeting took part of an invisible yet crushing amount of stress, anxiety and fear off my shoulders. It's the honest truth. Mr. Lamonsoff is so direct, take-charge yet funny and kind that I kicked myself multiple times wondering why I didn't have him as my attorney from the get-go. The associates at the firm are the most personable and knowledgeable attorneys I have ever known, and I have known plenty (I used to be a law secretary). No phone call goes unreturned, no e-mail goes ignored, no question goes unanswered. Not only that, but you are not treated as a nuisance. Your entire state is inquired about: mental, emotional AND physical. Knowing that I can seriously breathe and focus on my health and well-being and not feel alone and adrift in this madness called litigation is a gift. Mr. Lamonsoff and his firm gave me a piece of me back and has taken my entire fight in his hands. The way my case is going, I am soo happy I left my previous attorney and went to Mr. Lamonsoff.\n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend Michael Lamonsoff to everyone who asks and will continue to do so."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My life was completely turned upside down in a horrible work-related accident.
