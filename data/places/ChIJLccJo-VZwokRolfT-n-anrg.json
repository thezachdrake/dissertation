I thought it was complimentary part of the service, but when taken and sitting on the massage chair, I was told it was $15 USD for 10 mins and asked if I agreed to this. I did, and I was pleased to have a relaxing massage. After, the therapist finished my nails, I was happy with the colour, which I commented on.
