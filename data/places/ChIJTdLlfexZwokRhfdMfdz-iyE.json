I rarely take the time to post a review but I actually feel a responsibility to alert everyone to STAY AWAY from this restaurant!  The only thing this place has going for it is that the decor is somewhat nice,  especially upon first entering. However once we got inside and got settled it was actually far too hot and we asked several times for them to turn down the heat. The rest of the experience went downhill from there.  The service was terrible:  it took several attempts to get their attention to order.  When they brought out one of our appetizers,  which was supposed to be 'fried pork dumplings',  we noticed a strong fish odor.  Since that was not what we were interested in eating,  and the smell was very unpleasant,  we put dish to the side.  Then the server came over to inquire if there was a problem,  and we explained that it smelled like fish.  He told us that they had simply gone ahead and added shrimp to the dish, which was astonishingly irresponsible given that it could have triggered someone's allergies.  They took the food back,  apologized and gave us a credit for that dish.  The next problem arose when they brought only one entree,  not the other one.  I waited a long time without eating my own food to be polite to my son who had not yet been brought his dish.  After at least another 10 minutes passed we had to try to flag down a waiter to ask about the second dish.  It almost seemed as though they had forgotten about us.  In fact,  the whole wait staff seemed to be in a kind of trance.  The second dish -- which was supposed to be 'garlic marinated spare ribs' -- finally arrived.  However it did not appear to be marinated in anyway.  Instead it was dried and breaded and not at all fresh.  To top it all off,  the prices for this terrible meal were too high. Finally,  the women's bathroom is in a state of disrepair,  with an exposed wall where the 'flushing' handle should be,  and dirty floors.  Overall,  we came away angry,  still hungry,  and deeply disappointed.  Save your money and your health and stay away."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Terribly disappointing experience.
