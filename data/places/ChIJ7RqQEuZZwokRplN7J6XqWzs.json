The precision and attention to detail during the process were impressive.\n\nNot only did he masterfully execute the balayage, but the blow dry that followed was done exactly as I asked for. My hair looked and felt incredible, with a perfect balance of volume and smoothness.\nOnur’s passion for his craft is evident, and it reflects in the outstanding quality of his work. I know all his other clients feel the same way.\n\nBeyond the technical skill, the overall experience was really pleasant. He is super attentive, and ensured I felt comfortable throughout the appointment. As a fellow local business owner, we have a lot to chat about & I always look forward to our exchanges about running a business in the Big Apple on the Upper East Side.\n\nIf you're looking for a hair stylist who excels in balayage and blow dry techniques, I wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful place. I’ve also experienced visits with Onur’s staff, all of whom are kind, professional and attentive. Onur clearly trains everyone very well with care and love.
