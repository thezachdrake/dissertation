We would only have hot water for two hours at a time, and it would be over a weird schedule that would change. Ex. On from 6:30-8:30AM, then off till 10:30AM. This was never conveyed to us upon check-in and we had to find out after trying to take a shower later our first night.\n- The bathrooms were awkward in our room. The only separation is a sliding glass door that is fairly see-through and the first bed faced directly at the bathroom door. There’s a large bathroom fan in the roof that doesn’t seem to turn on/work. Make sure you’re very comfortable with who you’re traveling with cause you’re going to see and hear everything people are doing in the bathroom.\n- TVs were attached to a Chromecast that only sometimes worked. We couldn’t cast on both TVs at the same time in the two rooms as it appears they aren’t setup properly.\n-The room was only cleaned once for our 4 day stay. They mentioned rooms are only cleaned for longer stays but our rooms were never cleaned on the specified day and we had to inquire with the front desk and request a cleaning, get clean towels, etc.\n\nAs others mentioned it’s a decent option when only needing a place to sleep. Once they get through the growing pains of the renovation, it could be a good option for a single person or couples traveling.
