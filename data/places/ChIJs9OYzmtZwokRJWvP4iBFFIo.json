They never returned my $1000 Italian suit or my favorite $600 pucci silk shirt. They claim it’s not their fault and then blamed my bldg for losing it. Why would staff of my bldg go through my dirty clothes to steal? 3) they forgot to pickup my dry cleaning entirely which messed up what I could bring to my meetings abroad. In all my years of using dry cleaning services I have never seen this level of incompetence and irresponsibility. While Albert is a kind person, he won’t own up to my missing clothing. He will admit that they’ve been messing up a lot due to getting busier and not having well trained staff but can’t admit that this would lead to my clothes going missing. I wanted to support this small business so badly and let things go but the lost pucci shirt was the last straw. I recommend never using this place - they will just lose your favorite clothing and tell you they didn’t. So sad and disappointing bc these are two of my favorite pieces of clothing. So awful pls stay away!\n\nthey promised to reimburse me the replacement of these items and after chasing down their lawyer, they told me they would give me $88 which was 10x the cleaning.
