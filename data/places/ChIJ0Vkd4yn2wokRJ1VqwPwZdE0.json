This school collaborates with DOE for Pre-K for all program so most enrolled kids are eligible for a free UPK spot at the school. You get a 5-star education for free. 2. The school is very supportive and helpful in the Kindergarten school search and application. I can't thank Candace, the admission and eximission director, enough for her tireless effort in guiding us and advocating for my son and our family during this daunting process. We eventually got into a wonderful K-8 independent school with amazing financial aid. 3. My son learned so much socio-emotional skills at the school. He can verbalize his feelings very well, knows the right way to express his emotions and he even helped me to better manage my emotions. One time when I lost my temper, he calmly told me: \"Mom, I will wait here until you are ready to be nice to me\". He would call \"yellow light\" when I was about to lose it-- here I sound like a terrible parent, hahaha. 4. This school provides the top -notch Montessori education while manages to have the tuition much more affordable compared to other Montessori schools in the area. Anyway, I give a five-star to both the Park West and Riverside Montessori Schools. Check this school out and talk to parents here."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My son transferred from Park West Montessori School to Riverside Montessori School-RMS in the fall of 2020 (they are different campuses of Twin Parks Montessori School).

My daughter absolutely loves it here and looks forward to her days of “work.” I will say, I was a major skeptic... originally I thought why is there not math no science curriculum? But there is! It just isn’t forced or in the way I had been taught growing up. Surpassingly I  found myself learning from her! My daughter taught ME about Andrea Bocelli because she was introduced to his music in class. She was 3 when she came home requesting to hear his music. With my mouth dropped I quickly googled then asked Alexa to play his music. She’s learned to share, be patient, and most importantly be independent and a leader.
