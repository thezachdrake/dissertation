You have a list of the documents you need and also, whether they say print them or not I advise printing documents, because there is a lot hypocrisy going on.

Also there is no written list of documentation or directions on how the process of the tow pound works listed either. There's nothing online or posted at the location. So you are stuck only taking the word of the representative you speak to, which is ridiculous. Also when you speak to a rep or deal with any of the customer service people whether inperson or over the phone remember to get their name and rep number, record date and time you speak to them. This way you have proof of what you were told either over the phone or In person. Also only 1 rep had a name tag on out of 3 the others did not have a tag on, so it is imperative you ask. Also you can't park in facility so if someone brings you to pick up your vehicle, remember you will have to walk in a bit of a distance through water and gigantic muddy puddles. The best part of here is security. They were the best part of the experience they were professional kind and direct. You can trust what they say to be true, in terms of how they direct the process of you receiving and number, and how they treat you with respect and dignity.
