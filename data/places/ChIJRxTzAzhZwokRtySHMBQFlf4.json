All of the staff are very welcoming and helpful. When I walked in I was greeted by beautiful decor and a very sweet gentleman who attended to us as soon as we walked in. It took about five minutes for the vet assistant to come out and get us which is great timing. We went into this nice room and she complimented my little Missy with genuineness. She did the basic stuff asked the basic questions as is to be expected. She listened thoroughly to all of my questions and comments. She also gave Missy a treat before the doctor came in. Dr. Tong is super nice and gentle, he physically examined Missy and took his time. Whenever she was squirming the assistant and he would pet her to try to calm her. He answered every question I had as well as offered me information I needed to know. All around he is a pleasant Dr. After us all speaking they took Missy to another room for  her shots and he also gave me a complimentary nail trimming which was a super great surprise. When they finished a nurse brought her out to me and gave me her paperwork and things to look out for since she had her shots. I really love this place because of the people.
