I was extremely satisfied with my settlement and Mitch made sure he worked his hardest to get me what I deserved.

Together Mitch and Don make an amazing team and really go above and beyond to show you they care about you, your well being and your case. I really enjoyed working with them and would recommend them to anyone who might need assistance. My questions were always answered and in a timely manner. I’ve dealt with other lawyers/law firms before and I felt like they were only invested for getting the money and not for my concerns and the help I deserved, I never felt that way about Mitch. He’s very compassionate and good at what he does. I would tell anyone to definitely give them a call for a consultation and see for yourself the team that they are and you won’t be sorry. They would even call me about things that didn’t involve my case.  Mitch, Don and I really did form a special bond. I can’t thank you both enough for all you have done for me!
