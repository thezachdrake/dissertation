I did not meet her at this location, I met her at another location on Carrol Street.\n\nI went to the consultation, I thought everything went well. I explained to her that I am a college student who works part time and if there was a way that we can discuss a lower price for the sessions because she doesn't take insurance because I would have to pay out of pocket. She told me to get back to her on how much I could pay with my expenses. She said in the email, and I quote: \"The best I could offer at this time is to see you every other week at $75/hour. We can reevaluate in a couple months. I also need to know your availability. With this reduced rated I will prefer to see you at non-peak hours (2pm - 4pm)\". I was grateful. I said ok, I'm fine with that, but I have to see about my availability since I have school and work.\n\nI told her that I can see her during Spring Break around the non peak hours that she told me she will prefer to see me since I was given a \"reduced price\". I told her that I could most likely come in on Thursday, April 25th, 2019 at non-peak hours. She didn't think that I should wait until my spring break and that I could come in either 6:15 or 6:30pm on Wednesday.\n\nI agreed to Wednesday, April 10th, 2019 at 6:30 pm.

I told her that I thought the session was for an hour.\n\nMe asking her about something that she was not clear about or simply never said; something I was paying for out of pockets since she doesn't take insurance, regardless of a reduced price, just so that we are clear, made her, a therapist, extremely upset.\n\nShe sent me an email stating: \"Ok this is now too complicated. Therapy is 45 min, it’s referred to as an ‘analytic hour’; you leave after 45 minutes. Standard practice. At this point I don’t think I’m the right person for you. Please seek another therapist. Good luck.\"\n\nI was taken aback by her response because I thought that therapists were suppose to help. If there was something that she was unclear about or some kind of miscommunication and a client asked her to clarify, then why get upset if they are just trying to understand? Someone who decides to seek therapy is already trying to deal with other things that go on in their life, which is why they needed the help and/or someone to talk to in the first place. Her behavior was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL especially as a therapist.\n\nI was not out to inconvenience her in any way, but she spoke to me as if I knew that it was \"standard practice in the industry\" or as if it was my 3rd or 4th session and I was just now asking/concerned about how long the sessions are. I just wanted to be clear, since my session was suppose to be Wednesday, April 10th, 2019 at 6:30 PM and she was just telling me Monday, April 8th, 2019 that the sessions are not actually an hour AFTER the appointment was confirmed.
