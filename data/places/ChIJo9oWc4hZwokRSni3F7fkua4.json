Jay & Kenny handled every meeting professionally and walked us through our questions & made sure that we had a great wedding. They were so easy to work with - it was like talking to friends - even when we had to reschedule multiple times due to COVID. During the actual wedding, people were raving about the songs that got a traditional asian group dancing (awesome playlist & DJ'ing Jay!!). Kenny, you were incredible from the ceremony all the way through to the games; your perfect Chinese & English ensured that our guests knew what's going on. Everyone was super excited and pleased with how things turned out. THANK YOU and the crew for making our big day so special - couldn't have done it without you.
