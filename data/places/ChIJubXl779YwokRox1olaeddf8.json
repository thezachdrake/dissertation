Ok, it’s the Upper Eastside, I think. Maybe it’s excellent service and I won’t regret trying somewhere new (it’s right by my job). Wrong.

I asked for a third coat and she made several comments about how my nails were bumpy and that’s why the color looks like that. That really bothered me because it was clear that the nail wasn’t the cause of the transparent nail polish. She repeated SEVERAL times that I had a bumpy nails which was so rude and absolutely unnecessary. Then she told me that some ladies have long narrow toenails, but mine were short and wide. Again, rude. Then she tried to blame the poor job on the nail color. If she knew that nail polish was crumby, why would she let me continue with that color? Icing on the cake was when I was drying my nails, they had air bubbles. I tried to fix them myself since she did not check on me at all, only then she ran over and put on another coat. I gave her a $5 tip, even though I wanted to give her $3 to make it an even $40, and she did not even say thank you.
