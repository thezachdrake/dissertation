I don't know whether they screwed up, but I certainly wish I went to a different Dr or I just continued wearing contacts rather than spending the thousands of dollars for a botched and excruciatingly painful surgery (PRK was the most painful experience of my life). Then the wasted time and missed work or trekking to BK or the UES once a month to be told \"well it's not perfect 20/20 but it's close enough\"...As an update, I finally met with the Dr yesterday for the first time since surgery in November. He confirmed that I went from -6 vision to +1 in that eye, and I still don't really understand how this happened. He said only 2% of patients have to come back for a second PRK procedure, but having done more research I think this statistic is drastically understated. He gave me contacts to try, but even with them my vision isn't as clear as it was with contacts before the surgery.
