I was able to remove the stain in the 1st and only wash, but then the shirt was not sturdy enough to last one wash cycle.  One wash and air drying resulted in a small hole in the garment.

I am disappointed that the company has all of this discussion about high end suppliers, and taking care of the customers and all this, and they aren't willing to honor their customer when they provide a defective product.   Mind you this is my first purchase from Sid Mashburn.  The material did seem nice as it seemed very similar to a Peter Miller Polo that I have as well, but what kind of customer service is this to not provide a polo when it's defective? It seems that the customer service and all the statements of quality are smoke and mirrors."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is a review of the product, not of the store itself.
