No reservations.  A gentleman whom I presume is either the owner or the manager came out and was very friendly and welcoming.  We got seated outside.  I got the bagel \"tower\".  My son got a quiche.  I forget what other people got.  I enjoyed the bagel tower.  The salmon was good.  Bagel was not the best I ever had but certainly was worthy.  But the thing that knocked my socks off is that my son liked the quiche.  He is a picky eater with a very limited palate.  He never had quiche before and he only got it because the other things on the menu didn't appeal to him at all.  I tried the quiche.  It was light and fluffy.  Nothing like the \"quiche\" you find in so many bakeries,  delis, etc., that's basically an egg flavored paperweight.  Yes, the place is expensive.  But when I eat out, I want great taste, artistry, ambience, service, originality/trendiness (or adherence to classic traditions) and value.  I don't expect to get all of these aspects in one place but I expect at least one.  The more the better.  This place gave me taste, service and mastery of traditional cookery.  To reiterate, the place isn't cheap for most budgets (I'm Upper Middle Class) but to me, I'd rather pay a lot for quiche my son enjoys then going to some cheap joint that serves something noone enjoys.  If I ever break through to Lower Upper Class, I'm definitely making this a regular part of my weekend brunch circuit.  Until then, I may not go here often but if I'm visiting the Met or Guggenheim again, I'd rather eat here than some crappy cheap local joint."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Stopped by on a cold winter day on the way to the Met Museum with the whole family.
