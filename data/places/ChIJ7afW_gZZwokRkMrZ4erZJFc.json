We went to dinner thinking it would be a normal dinner and it turned into a three or four hour fun adventure! The chef was so passionate about his food and you could tell loved to just experiment with whatever was freshest. He came over and chatted with us for awhile and we loved it!! Great service, great food! Can’t wait to go back. The restaurant is very small. There is only one four seat table and two spots for bar seats with ~4-6 spots.
