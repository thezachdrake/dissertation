Not only is it a fully rounded extremely well crafted, 100+ year foundation, but it is also fun and stimulating for families. Let’s breakdown why. First, it’s about the heads of the school, Emily and Disha, they’ve worked so hard to creat an environment of love, caring and attentiveness for the teachers and students to work within. Their attention to detail is outstanding, and their constant communication with each and every family is above and beyond. Next, it’s about the teachers, ALL of them are high level educators well versed in the methodology behind Montessori and Guidepost is the most original practice you’ll find. We get weekly updates about not only the individual progress our child is achieving, but we also get classroom information and pictures. And to top that off, I have daily conversations with them at drop off, so I feel more supported on this journey, and trust me, as a mom, that’s priceless! Now for the facility—- WOW OH WOW this place is STUNNING. Bright sunny SPACIOUS classrooms complete with a rooftop terrace and garden and basement that is extraordinary, library, play space, huge mat for classes and kids kitchen and arts and crafts section! It’s brand new, they’ve truly built this space to be the ultimate happy place for our children.
