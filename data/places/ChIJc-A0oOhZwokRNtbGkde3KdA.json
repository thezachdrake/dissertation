First time trying to park here. This can't be real! I'm a tenant in the adjacent building and we were told we get a discount on parking at this garage.\n\nI tried to park just now. I was quoted the standard rate as advertised in the sign outside. Not a discount rate.\n\nWhen I asked about the tenant discount he said yes, and kept quoting me the original rate.\n\nI told him I was told otherwise.  Mind you it was really difficult to have a conversation as everything this man said, he yelled at me while acting incredibly impatient so that I felt rushed.\n\nI told him again that I was told tenants get a discounted rate and that if that weren't the case if park elsewhere. He just looked blankly at me as he didn't understand what I was saying.\n\nSo I told him that if my building was mistaken about the discount then I dont want to park here.\n\nThen he just yelled at me \"Nine dollars!\"\n\nWhat, nine dollars to leave?\n\nI told him \"No. I'm not parking here.\"\n\nThen he angrily waved me forward, into an area with many signs marked \"exit\". Which exit sign do I follow?\n\nThen some guy comes out and looks at me incredulously as if to say \"What are you doing in here???\" I wasn't supposed to go this way I suppose so the man insist on turning my car around for me. So I let him in my car which he drives WITH NO CARE WHATSOEVER back to where I started.\n\nListen. This isn't \"Let's Make A Deal\". This isn't money laundering. I'm not trying to pull one over on someone.\n\nI just want a coherent answer to my question. Either \"Yes, the discounted rate is X\" or \"Sorry, what you were told is incorrect. We dont have discounted parking for tenants.\"\n\nOf course when I called the number hoping to get a straight answer, it rang and rang but no answer. After a few tries to call back the same guy answers. When he recognized my voice and/or my question he said \"Blue Honda? WE'RE FULL!\"\n\nI've now spent 20 minutes calling back again and again hoping to either get an answer or at least annoy the piss out of these jerks.\n\nWho is running this business? Because your employees hate their jobs, hate their customers, and apparently they hate their boss.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYou can see the company's response below to my review.\n\nHere's what this tells me about the company.\n\nSaying \"there has been a miscommunication\" is a subtle way of deflecting responsibility (even if o my publicly so as to save face).\n\nWhat WORKS? What would work in this situation would be to say \"It sounds like we might have miscommunicated to someone. Could you put us in touch with the party that have you this information? Perhaps we can reach out to clear things up.\"\n\nWhat this also tells me is that they aren't sorry.\n\n\"We apologize for the experience you had, however...\"\n\nIt the word HOWEVER that is of importantance here.\n\nTake note - this is a form of victim blaming.  \"I'm sorry this happened to you, BUT... here's why it happened to you, and that wasn't out fault.\"\n\nThe only appropriate response to my review would be to say \"Regardless of the misinformation, you should never be spoken to in that way. Not by our staff. Not by anyone. Please contact so-and-so and we will work to make this right.\"\n\nTo be clear, the staff was outright hostile towards me. And why? Because I had a yes or no question.\n\nAll your staff needed to say was \"I'm sorry. I'm not sure why you were told that. We do not offer discounted parking for tenants\" and I could have been on my way.\n\nAnother thing that isn't addressed in the company's response -- your staff's attempt to charge me $9 NOT to park there. In other words, and attempt to intimidate me into paying $9 for them to let me out.\n\nThis is a practice I know to be illegitimate, because when I didn't stand for it, the guy backed down and just let me go.\n\nLastly, based on the company's kurt reply, I get what's going on here.
