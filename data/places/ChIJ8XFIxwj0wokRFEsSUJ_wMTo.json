UPDATE: Results took 6 days. By subway, the 1 train and M100 go right there, and the A train's Dyckman Street stop is a couple blocks away.\n\n1. We were in line at 8:48am on a Monday, and all finished by 10:15am. A long line formed quickly after we arrived so I would recommend arriving at 8:45 or earlier. One staffer told me the line often gets longer during the day.\n\n2. We got Covid-19 tests (nasal swab) and antibody tests (blood draw). This was my husband and me and our kids, ages 11 and 9; 8 tests in total. We didn't have passports or birth certificates of the kids with us, but my husband showed the staff photos in his phone of the kids' passports and that was acceptable. I recommend bringing passports, or birth certificates or some other documentation for your kids if you plan to get them tested. My husband and I had our IDs, which they checked twice.\n\n3. It was very well organized, friendly staff, other people getting tested were safe, social distancing on the sidewalk. They had Spanish speaking staff as well. All signs were in Spanish and English.\n\n4. There is a lot of paperwork to fill out and it seemed clear that they don't take you for testing until its complete. We went to the back of the line but someone told us to go get the clipboards and the paperwork, so I did that while my husband stood in line with the kids. Most of the paperwork is repetitive; contact info and forms. You only fill out the highlighted parts. We also had to fill out the packet of forms for each of our kids and sign for them. They ask for your social security number on the forms. It was a highlighted (required) field on my husband's form but not on mine. I didn't fill out my ssn, for privacy/security reasons. No one asked me for it.\n\n5. The line moved mostly in order but sometimes the staff pulled out people behind us to go first, or maybe they were just explaining their paperwork. This seemed frustrating, but perhaps there's a reason for it. Maybe those people had certain symptoms.\n\n6. We brought water, we all drank it, but our younger son didn't drink enough. For the blood draw, it was a pinch and 3ish seconds for all of us, not so bad. But for our younger son, the blood was not flowing too quickly. In retrospect, I should have made sure he drank more while we were waiting in line. However, it appears there is no bathroom there, so plan accordingly.  There might be a bathroom at a local store; not sure.\n\n7. The tests: At first, a staffer told me to come into the tent by myself, but when I told the healthcare worker in the tent I was with family, they brought them in. The separation might have happened because our last names are different. They allowed me to be with the kids while they had the blood draw and nasal swab. (They actually sent overa specific woman who is great with kids - much appreciated!)  Three out of four of us were able to get the nasal swab done in one nostril, but they warn you that they might need to try both if first does not work. We all agreed the nasal swab was annoying, but not painful. It only took a few seconds, but afterwards, I still felt weirdness in my nose for several minutes. Everyone else in my family was fine once it was over. I took ibuprofen when I got home and felt fine minutes later; should have brought that with me.\n\n8. Results:  The forms we filled out said 7 to 14 days for results, but the staffer that did the test showed us where we can sign up at a website and get the results, which I think is faster.  Originally, we were considering getting the test with the quick results, but I have heard they are not as reliable.\n\n9. Cost: The sign says the tests are free, and there was no cost for us.

We did not give them an insurance card."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Our family went here in August 2020 for Covid (corona) & antibody tests, and overall, it was a very positive experience.
