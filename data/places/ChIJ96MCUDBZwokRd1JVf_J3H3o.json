I am giving them 2 stars, because they came back to finish my roof after it leaked from my bedroom to the kitchen after they replaced two roofs in my house to brand new, so I thought. I have a 75 year warranty on the metal roof and the asphalt roof has a 25 year warranty. Yet, I can’t get a hold of anyone to come back to repair again.  Initially, I was informed that they knew how to connect asphalt to a metal roof in an old historic house. I suggested just using metal for the whole job because my asphalt roof order had to be changed, but they refused to change my order to 2 metal roofs. Now, my bedroom ceiling is leaking again. Their email addresses are bouncing and their number keeps saying it’s busy. They took advantage of us as an older couple and then told us if we call them again they will charge us for the repair. I don’t recommend this roofing company since the BBB gives them a F rating for not getting back to them to solve matters like these.
