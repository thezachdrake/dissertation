Around noon, my friend and I decided to park the car in this garage to recharge it, around noon. We were greeted by a man who appeared to be from Latin America, and when we asked him how much it would cost to charge the vehicle, he charged us $50.00 for the service. He said that we should pay him half in cash and the other half when we returned, and that he would take care of charging the vehicle.\n\nHowever, when we returned four hours later, the vehicle only had an extra 36 miles of battery. We had to pay another $25.00 to the attendant, who explained that we shouldn't have paid cash to the first garage attendant. We tried to locate the garage attendant, whose name was either Jose or Jorge, but he was no longer on shift. He had spoken to us in Spanish, which is my first language, so I had understood him perfectly when he charged me $50.00 to charge my car in cash.\n\nUnfortunately, we had to wait another hour to charge some additional miles, and by then it was almost 5pm and getting dark to drive up back to Boston. We wasted our time charging at this location and lost our money. It's sad to encounter people who take advantage of others, especially when they see women alone and try to deceive them. Please be cautious when using this garage for charging services."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was visiting NYC on Monday, April 24th - 2023, and my electric car had very little charge left to leave the city.
