The moment I took my first sip of their cold brew, I was blown away by its rich and smooth flavour. It was the perfect balance of boldness and subtle sweetness. Whether you're a coffee connoisseur or just a casual drinker, you're bound to appreciate the quality and craftsmanship that goes into their brews.\nTheir matcha was pretty good too!\n\nWhat truly sets this coffee bar apart, however, is the exceptional service provided by the young, cool lads who work here. They are not only knowledgeable about their craft but also genuinely passionate about creating an enjoyable experience for their customers. Their polite and friendly demeanor makes you feel instantly welcome, and their dedication to delivering top-notch service is commendable. They should be proud of the welcoming vibe they create.\n\nAlthough the coffee bar is small and cozy, it does not compromise on comfort. The few available seats are comfortable and well-maintained, allowing you to relax and savor your cup of joe. The intimate setting fosters a sense of connection, making it an ideal spot for studying, catching up with friends, or simply taking a break from the bustling university environment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that due to its size, this coffee bar does not have toilet facilities available. While this might be a minor inconvenience, it is understandable given the limited space they have. As a customer, I didn't find it to be a major issue, but it's worth considering if you require immediate restroom access. (I now saw they have two other locations)\n\nIn conclusion, if you're searching for a fantastic cup of coffee in a cool and inviting atmosphere, this small coffee bar is the place to be. The excellent coffee, combined with the exceptional service from the friendly and knowledgeable staff, creates an experience that is sure to leave you impressed!
