Upon arrival to the pick up location the bus was already leaving at 1:25pm and I was left behind to catch the next bus which was set to depart at 4pm, but was told by a Wanda coach employee that I would have to pay $15 extra to board because I missed the first bus which left before the advertised departure time.

On the bus there is a bathroom and the toilet was filled to the brim with urine, feces and I don’t know what else just swishing splashing around in the overflowing toilet. The bus itself was very dusty and dirty and has no air circulation to let out the bad air. Also this company transports cigarettes along with other illegal goods from Georgia and along the route to NYC and forces customers on the bus to go inside gas stations and buy cartons of cigarettes to sell in NYC which isn’t taxed. I am asking that this company be investigated for not providing a clean and safe bus for customers who are traveling long distances without proper inspection along with safety and health concerns. I am asking to have the buses sanitized and inspected including the bathroom before and after each trip. Also to make sure every person is accounted for before leaving after each break stop. Because they have left people stranded in different cities in dark and unsafe locations if they don’t get back on the bus whenever the driver is ready.
