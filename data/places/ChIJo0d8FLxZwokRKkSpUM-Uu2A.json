After ten minutes of touring the apartment, Josh and I were talking about family upbringing, and our love and admiration for our mothers.He even mentioned- at this point we're extended family. That was very reassuring. Not only were they super supportive and patient with my situation, they helped me find my perfect home. They are very much goal oriented and solution focused. Even when we hit roadblocks- the wheels in Alan's head were constantly spinning and searching for remedies. They were very caring and efficient. From the date I put in my application, to the day I got keys- was a total of five business days. I had been apartment hunting for months and they got it done in FIVE days.\nTheir conversations were organic in nature and they have this intrinsic motivation to be exceptional realtors. They kept me up to date on every aspect of the process- text, phone, email, etc. -no matter the time of day- they were responsive. Yes, there's money exchanged at the end but I sense that both Alan and Josh get their satisfaction from providing quality service- and that can't be taught, it's an innate personality trait.
