I’d recommend the Trust Me and ordering additional pieces a la carte. The larger lunch definitely gives you exposure to different pieces but the real noticeable one would be the Lobster hand roll and Pink lobster nigiri. Pictured is the salmon sashimi, chutoro, salmon, albacore nigiri, toro hand roll, chutoro, pink lobster, sea bream and unagi nigiri. All were fantastic with shoutouts to the salmon and the toro.
