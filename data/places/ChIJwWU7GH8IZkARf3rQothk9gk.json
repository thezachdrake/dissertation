We have had a very dangerous amount of BLACK MOLD growing on one side of the apartment since November and it took them TWO MONTHS to get maintenance in here to “fix” it, and by fix I mean they sprayed it with bleach and told us we’d be fine (it came back shortly after and I’ve had to spend unnecessary amounts of time spraying and scrubbing it off of our walls) Not only did it take maintenance 2 months to come in, they let themselves in with little to no warning on multiple occasions. We have attempted to contact the company on countless occasions about getting things fixed, getting the rent reduced, getting heat and we get 0 response. They don’t answer their phones and the best response we get is a link to maintenance request forms, which mind you they almost never follow trough with. We’ve had 3 separate shelves snap with plates and glassware on them nearly crush us, barely any heat (its literally 50-60 degrees or less in our apartment in the middle of winter), black mold, leaks from the windows, maintenance people letting themselves in with no notice, packages stolen and very very little correspondence.
