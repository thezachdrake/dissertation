When I told Krys about what I was looking for her, she helped me buy amazing pieces for summer and fall; work and home; casual and formal. The pieces were a variety of price points (by my request), and things I never would have picked out for myself! She immediately understood my concerns about clothes after 2 babies and this was reflected in the pieces she chose for me. I have some amazing outfits for work and going out with friends now!\n\nOne thing to note is she is great at navigating tricky stores. For example, I have never shopped at ASOS because I am overwhelmed by the amount of clothes they have. She is great at figuring out what's good, and she helped me get 5 tops and dresses at amazing prices that fit great!\n\nI just asked her to help shop for my husband, and can't wait to buy the pieces she recommends for him!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Krys is awesome!
