The Function Room is incredible for any informal meetings or formal conferences. However, the Function room is also SUPER lovely for auspicious & religious events. Situated ideally in front of the Hudson River, 50 Riverside shows pride in its luxurious lobby area, clean and welcoming atmosphere, and great lighting fixtures.\n\nThe Function Room's various amenities (including a catering kitchen and private screening room) are immaculate, with a unique outdoor, landscaped garden courtyard, allowing for calming overflow when guests need fresh air. If the weather is nice enough, consider hosting your entire event outside! The indoor and outdoor areas are perfect for an intimate pre-wedding ceremony or a small reception, with a space that comfortably fits 50-60 guests.\n\nWhile it is more of a secret, intimate location, it's still far beyond your average \"dawat space\" or meeting room — have I mentioned that the 35 stories above overlook the Hudson River!? The gorgeous park area right beside the building also offers a beautiful space to relax with family or hang out with a few friends after a long day spent at your beautiful event.\n\nThe apartment complex was masterfully crafted in 2013 and has garnered a reputation for incredibly luxurious service, whether you're a newcomer or a 20-year-long resident. 50 Riverside is magnificent inside and out: the culture and ambiance cannot be described in words.
