I've only now become strong enough to talk about my experience with Paradise Suites. I chose this Airbnb because it was close to Sloan for my extended care, and the ad boasted a first-floor, private entrance, a bright living space and private patio.  (The first floor and private patio area have since been removed from the Airbnb listing).  After spending months in the hospital, the ability to have a private outdoor space and easy access to “home” was incredibly appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, as soon as I arrived, it was clear the apartment wasn’t as advertised and wouldn’t be safe for me to stay there.\n\nThe entrance to the apartment required a long walk inside a slippery, dank alley. There was water on the floor.  There was an obvious odor of mildew and a green growth on parts of the alley walls. There were also bags of powdered concrete lining the already narrow space.  I have attached pictures of the entryway to this review.  I wish I had taken more.\n\nWhile the apartment is technically street-level, it’s basically in the basement of the building (not a first floor) with no elevator access to the main lobby.  To reach the main elevator, you need to walk up several outside steps to the front door.\n\nHad the entrance been explained in a clear, transparent way, I would not have booked the apartment. Patients like me are extremely vulnerable to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections that can quickly become life-threatening.\n\nIt was the concern over the exposure to such a damp and potentially unhealthy entryway that led to the immediate decision not to stay. My family and I contacted the host right away and were offered other apartments in the same building. While appreciated, they didn’t suit my needs.  I needed an apartment that was large enough to accommodate my medical equipment and for a family member to stay with me 24/7.\n\nGiven my unique medical circumstances, I emailed the host directly and asked them to refund my payment for the one month stay. As per Airbnb policy, the host has a certain timeframe to respond. I never heard from them. I then reached out to Airbnb Support, explained my circumstances, and provided pictures and a letter from my physician explaining my immune compromised situation. My physician clearly stated that it was unsafe for me to stay there. But Airbnb support told me that the host is standing by their cancellation policy and will not refund me any money.\n\nI understand that technically that is within their rights: Airbnb's cancellation policy allows only for natural disasters, government-declared emergencies, epidemics, and similar. But the host always has the option to refund (full or partial), and they chose not to.\n\nThere was absolutely no way my family and I could have known about any of these issues until sending my payment and checking in at the apartment. We tried to do the right thing by contacting them as soon as possible and explaining the very personal details of my medical condition. We desperately tried to appeal to their compassion but received none.
