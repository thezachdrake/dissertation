Turns out ours was his first, so in a way we took a chance, and man am I glad we did! I really can't say enough about the quality of his work and how much care, energy, and passion he puts into all of it. It's not easy to make a business event look exciting and beautiful, but somehow he does. He has a way with his subjects and making them feel comfortable, engaged, and open that works in any setting whether it's a business conference or somewhere in Bhutan. He's really one of the most versatile and talented photographers I have the pleasure of knowing, and we plan to hire him again and again."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"A few years ago, I found Vince's incredibly impressive travel photography work online and wasn't sure if he did corporate events.
