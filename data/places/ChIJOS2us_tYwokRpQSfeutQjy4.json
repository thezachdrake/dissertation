unhealthy.  I spent 3 months interviewing new dentists for what would be the most critical and potentially most expensive procedures I would ever have and the stakes were high.\n\nEnter New York Smile Institute.  Out of the four New York City doctors I interviewed this office had the best staff who followed me through the entire procedure (Including one who eventually retired to Florida and yet STILL contacted me months later to congratulate me on the procedures being completed!).  Their customer service goes beyond the office, if there's any questions they will be happy to answer via e-mail or phone and when you arrive they know all the details required from your insurance, finances and personal preferences to have me feel like I was important.\n\nNow for the procedures!   It's hard not to cry when I share this as Dr. Dean Vafiadis has the deserved confidence of a master craftsman.  Minimal pain, minimal time in the chair AND he was working with an unusual case of redoing another dentists shoddy job plus  my bite and other jaw issues came in to play - he designed teeth and veneers to counter these issues that not only improved my smile but my bite.  My chronic lock jaw disappeared.  The muscles in my face softened.  The color of my teeth?  He had me visit a lab and have a great, long conversation looking at options I didn't even know were possible as Dr. Dean wanted to make certain after my first negative experience in my past where my teeth were almost a blue white didn't happen again.  The lab helped me decide on a soft natural tooth color, shapes that were slightly youthful at the tip of each tooth and a translucency that was incredibly natural.  As a side note - I had to replace a tooth far after the final procedure (baby tooth needed an implant) and I was incredibly anxious on the color and size so close to the front of my mouth and new teeth, however,  with the skills, new technologies and being on the cusp of dental advancements in this office and being a study institute Dr. Dean was able to create a new process that was painless, healing rapid and my new permanent tooth looks no different than the rest (thanks to the lab again doing a job of perfection color-wise).  I couldn't tell which tooth it was, that is how well matched the color was!\n\nWhen I smile people don't say, \"wow, your teeth are so white!\" they say, \"your face lights up when you smile\".   This was a life changing experience with what I can only imagine must be the best in the business because people think I have amazing original teeth, but the secret it out!  They are all veneers!  In fact, while doing my last procedure I had a few fellow dentists come in to admire my mouth and Dr. Dean's craftsmanship.  What does that say?\n\nIf you are anxious about how to begin these were the best people to help curb that as they guide you through the entire process and really listen to you.   If you are worried about cost, remember your mouth is a forever investment that you see everyday for health and cosmetic reasons.  Don't be like me and be forced to do it twice because my first dentist was economical and convenient and not a specialist.   Go with the best the first time round.  I had to pay for these teeth twice and my regret will always be that I didn't do my homework the first time and realize you get what you pay for.\n\nThe talent in this office is exceptional.  I want to thank New York Smile Institute for giving me my confidence and my smile back."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am a patient who came from a past traumatic and expensive dental procedure (including caps and veneers) that left my teeth far too white and unhealthy.
