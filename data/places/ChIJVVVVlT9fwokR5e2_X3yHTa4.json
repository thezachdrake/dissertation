Hence I just picked them randomly from the list and called them on Wednesday March 12th in order to confirm if they carried Medela Electric Breast Pumps, which I require (I recently delivered a baby). One of the male staff told me that they do carry the same and that he required our physician to send over a prescription for the breast pump to which I said it would be done. I then called them once again after half an hour to RE-CONFIRM whether they carried it. A female staff answered this time and told me that she would transfer the line to the person in charge. Thats when the same male staff that I had spoken with earlier came on the line and re-confirmed that they absolutely do carry the Medela Electric Breast Pump. He even went so far to tell me that the insurance would cover only the single breast pumps and not the doubles, which i was totally ok with. I wanted to reconfirm that they carry it only since I wanted to make sure that I was giving the correct information to my physician since she would have to take time out of her busy schedule (and she is extremely busy) to type up the prescription for me, and would then have to fax over my prescription to them. Anyhow, I called the hospital and did the needful. Today, Thursday, March 13th, I called American Medical Products to ask if they had received the prescription. A female staff who was extremely rude, by the name of Lucia (yes, I made sure to get her name) told me that they received the prescription but had no idea why I would have the hospital send over a prescription for something that they did not carry! Shocked by her extremely rude behavior I told her that someone from her store clearly confirmed with me twice just yesterday that they carried it. She told me that it wasn't possible and that they either dont carry any electric breast pumps or they're out of stock. Instead of apologizing, she was beyond rude with me. Anyhow, I then found out another company that carried the electric breast pumps and then called American Medical Products back to ask if they could fax over the prescription that they received from my physician to the other company that I had found out about. To my luck, it was the Lucia again who answered and I requested if she could do that. Her reply to me was that if she had the time to fax it over today, she would or I would have to wait until tomorrow. I told her that I really needed the pump and that faxing would only take her a minute. She told me that it was her decision as to when she would fax it over and told me to call her tomorrow and just hung up the phone. Im still in a state of shock as to her outrageously rude behavior and how insulting she was to me. Moreover, since I am very soft-spoken and polite as a person in general. If I would have been rude to her, I can understand her being rude in return. But that was far from true. I have never in my life encountered someone this rude and felt it was my duty to put this on record and inform others out there so that they dont have to go through whatever I had to with this company, and are aware of their extremely irresponsible and rude behavior. What I believe is that no one is taking anything free from them. Either the insurance pays them or the patient/customer does. Therefore they are making money off of all their customers and should atleast behave responsibly , not give out incorrect information (especially in the medical field), and then instead of apologizing for their mistake be extremely rude to their customers. This is totally unacceptable and hence the word needs to go out there warning others about this. Thanks for taking the time out to read my review."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"American Medical Products in Astoria, Queens (NY) are one of the companies listed by our insurance plan.
