But then the Friday before the camp I also called to confirm. They explained that masking and vaccines were no longer required nor was testing (which it had said in the description), but said my kid could eat his lunch outside as their one concession. I asked if they had HEPA filters and/or open windows and they said they had central air and could open windows if requested. I said, I would prefer that. They agreed to do so. Then over the weekend e-mailed me that it was too hot to open the windows so they had no plans for ventilation. I'm sure you can guess where this is going - our kid, after 2 and a half years,  got COVID.  Apparently there was kid there on the first day who was coughing, sneezing and not wearing a mask. They didn't open any windows. They didn't isolate and test or call home. He stayed the whole day but was gone the rest of the week. It turned our household upside down. I wrote to the camp immediately once we got a positive test. No response from them. Not even an acknowledgement that they got my note. Not to mention, my child really learned nothing from the camp. No real lessons or projects to point to. We would have been better off, spent less money, learned more and been healthier if we had just opted for Outschool."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I wish I had seen some of the reviews here before I sent my son to a Lavner game coding camp on the Lower East Side in 2022.
