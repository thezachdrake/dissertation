It was so scrumptious I would have ditched on the other dishes but I had a plan. Next up, I ordered the marinated beef pocket buns and kimchi bun and was disappointed. Recently tried bao buns (pecking duck) for the first time and have been craving it so I was excited but that wasn't the case for either buns. I would admit I took a little while before eating it but the temperature wasn't the main problem. The kimchi bun was ...un-kimchi like tasting and soggy and the other literally fell apart. The onnly thing I enjoyed was the Shredded veggie on the pocket bun.\nI went ahead to order a bowl of cheese tteokbokki and sotteok sotteok (sausage rice cake skewer) I've wanted to try for so long and a winter melon green tea. I enjoyed them all.\nOn the third floor I discovered the photo booth and had a good time for a first timer. The vibe on the third floor is different from the others.  I got to enjoy my taro ice-cream (another first time experience) on the third floor while enjoying the gloomy view. Definitely coming back... soon! Got more cravings to satiate and more pic to take.\nEdit: I went 3 days in a row since I had so many things to try and craved. I missed out on the k-hotdog on the 2nd day but I got the custard cream  fish shaped pastry  and the everything kimbab.  Damn the kimbab was SOO good (craving it rn) meanwhilethe pastry was alright. On the third day, I tried the potato and cheetos khotdogs and they didn't hit the spot like the first time. It was super greasy. Probably should have let it cool more.
