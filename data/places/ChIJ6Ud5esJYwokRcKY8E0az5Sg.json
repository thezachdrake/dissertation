It was great talking to him. However, the receptionist is very rude. Poor customer service from any perspective. I was scheduled for a procedure a month prior. I had to make arrangements along with my spouse who was supposed to pick me up. The week before I started calling to see whether the procedure was approved because my insurance didn't not have anything on file. The receptionist told me it was not her responsibility because she just passes the documents to a billing department that probably started the paperwork only a week before the procedure or \"That's how they do things\". I asked her to call me back with at least an insurance estimates so that I know I do not end up with $$$$ bill if it doesn't go through the insurance and speed up the process. The receptionist called me back only a day before the procedure and almost yelled at me for cancelling, even though i was calling her every day asking about this situation. She still didn't not give me a fair estimate (only provided with information that I already knew, like 20% copay and deductible). 20% copay could be anything from $10 to $10000 and so on. I know I need an approved  preauthoruzation to get any type of major service through my insurance. Patient's total responsibility was not mentioned to me either. When I asked to reschedule, she said she needed to cancel an appointment and can't reschedule and then hanged up on me. Oh yeah, she also messed up my name after giving numerous forms and a state ID. I really liked the doctor. But it's New York. I can find another great specialist across the street."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Very personable doctor. It was great talking to him.
