It is an unwanted alarm EVERY morning! Several people in my building have complained to no avail. I am a seasoned special educator and I feel just terrible for these children who are being neglected and ignored. Their poor cries shriek of sadness. The director of this program should be evaluated. There are so many other alternatives to meet their emotional needs rather than sticking them outside to scream all morning. I have a recording in my phone of child having a meltdown and the teachers are simply ignoring her. Why not teach her coping strategies? From what I’ve read this is a center for emotionally disturbed children and I have to say the support they are providing is grossly insufficient. Furthermore, it is located in a the middle of two apartment buildings. Have some considered in for your neighbors and plan your schedule out in a way that is respectful. Sending children out to “play” at 8 in the morning while neighbors may be resting and tending to their own children is irresponsible. It sounds more like a refugee camp or asylum than the laughter and joy of children playing. I have just about had it. I have called 311 to make a complaint,  but I think I need to take it to the board because it  is unfair how these children are treated. I would not recommend this center to anyone with a child with severe emotional needs."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"While I have never attended this center, it is shared with my apartment building and it has been an awful 4 years living above this center.
