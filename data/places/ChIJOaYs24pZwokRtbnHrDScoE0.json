I made the HUGE mistake of bringing my garments to clean to this place because it's a little closer to my apt. I have been taking my clothes for years to White on White cleaners in TriBeCa and I never had an issue.\nI picked up my clothes and the next day I was going to wear one of the blouses I took to American Thread Cleaners. When I took it out of the plastic bag from the cleaners I noticed it had a big slash on the right sleeve and a similar mark exactly on the same location on the left sleeve. It's an expensive blouse and I probably wore it 5 times since I bought it. The blouse is so damaged that it's impossible for me to wear it. I went back the next day and the business was closed, I tried again twice and they were still closed. I was finally able to get them on the phone and went in person. I arrived with the best intention and disposition, I even brought an additional cashmere sweater for them to dry clean. Because I understand things happen sometimes and I was sure they were going to be nice about my blouse (basic customer service). I was in shock when the manager of the business started questioning me and suggesting I damaged the garment after I picked it up from their business. He went off explaining to me how it was impossible for their solvents to damage clothes like that, he said that if it was their fault the damage will be all over my blouse not only on the sleeves! Then he proceeded to ask me how come the damage was only on the sleeves like I knew!!! He said he will have to send it to a laboratory for an investigation to find out what really happened and that I had to cover the almost $200 fee to do it. He said they were not going to reimburse me for giving me credit if the results showed that the solvent didn't damage the garment. I pointed out that it didn't matter how it happens because the blouse was ruined and I couldn't wear it. What I needed to know was if the business was going to pay for the garment or offer me credit. He said no because the damage was not made by the solvents they use! I then told him that on the receipt it was clear that the business will offer to pay for some damages as long they don't exceed 10 times the value of the service rendered. I showed him the back of their receipt where it says that and the manager said: 'I don't believe in those terms\". I said that was outrageous because that was the receipt of the business. I said I could place a complaint in a small cases court. As soon as I said that, a middle-aged man with a strong middle eastern accent came out from the back of the store, claiming to be the owner. When I explained to him that the blouse I picked up from his cleaners was damaged he said that was not possible, he suggested that something happened to my blouse after I picked it up. The manager supported him and I asked them not to call me a liar and he responded that I was the one calling them liars because they didn't damage my blouse.  Once again, the owner suggested sending my blouse to a laboratory to find out if the solvent was the cause and offered to pay for my blouse if that was the case, I agreed but then he said I will have to pay the almost $200 fee lab and also he wanted me to APOLOGIZE to him and the manager for falsely accusing them if it turned out the solvent didn't damage the garment.  Bottom line, they wanted me: 1. Pay almost $200 to find out if a solvent had torn the sleeves of my blouse. 2. Get no reimbursement or credit.  3. On top of it all, I have to apologize to both of them for my wrongdoing! INSANITY\nIn 18 years I have never been treated with so much disrespect in any business in NYC.
