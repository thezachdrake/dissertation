You will wait, and wait and wait some more. I do not like it and believe me, my time is limited as it is for most working, commuting, city ladies. BUT this woman is an extraordinary doctor. She is honest and to the point - there is no sugar coating on her end. If you can handle the wait and her direct approach, Dr. Brandeis is spot on in her diagnostics and extremely thorough - which is why you end up waiting. She takes the time needed with her patients on an individual basis and that is where the office runs into scheduling problems. In my opinion, she is worth the wait once or twice a year. She takes women's health issues very seriously and doesn't just go through the motions. She is an educator and brings a vast amount of knowledge and experience to her practice. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 over the long wait times and no use of email - but I still think Ilona Brandeis is a top notch doctor."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I've been a patient here for over 10 years.
