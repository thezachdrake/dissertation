The M11 Northbound Bus is literally right across our building.\n\nOn June 18th at 8:03am we saw the M11 bus pull in to the 59th street stop we were literally crossing infront of the bus and not even 15seconds at the stop as soon as she saw us she rolled her eyes and she closed the door refused to let us in and pulled out in a very dangerous manner that she almost ran my son and I over. She sped away so fast I couldnt catch her bus number. Imagine it was raining too and it was soo scary. I was livid to say the least. We waited 15 mins for the next bus and I spoke to the next M11 driver who told me he will talk to her.\n\nThis morning June 19th 8:02am again we were crossing to get to the bus stop as per the app saying it's pulling in and we were literally right across the bus as it pulled in, a car passed and as soon as she saw us not even 10 seconds this time she closed the door looked me and my son and stuck her tongue out at us as she tried to speed away but there was a red light so I was able to catch up to take pictures of the bus and video record this unprofessional, disgusting, mentally unstable person. The guard in my building saw the whole thing too and was so mad at the way she treated me and my son, \"she saw you guys and she just closed the door and sped away! She just pulled in so fast, that's not right and she didnt even let you in!\".\n\nThis is not how an MTA employee should treat a paying customer let alone people in general. My son was so upset and cried because we witnessed a grown adult bullying him and his mom and you can tell she visibly took pleasure at upsetting people and kids. He was crushed because we just planned his birthday party at the Transit Museum and was going to buy extra MTA busses to add to his collection and this incident really traumatized him. He adores the MTA bus drivers since he was little. This bus driver's behavior was extremely alarming and beyond unprofessional. As a medical professional I am afraid that she is putting people in danger by her in poor judgement skills, how she dangerously operates a vehicle, arrogance, petty attitude and unsafe practices. I spoke to the same bus driver after her and he mentioned he spoke to her yesterday. Her actions today was calculated, cunning and clear signs of retaliation against us. She has no business representing a reputable organization such as the MTA. She is a disgrace to the uniform and an extremely poor example for children.\n\nI have already sent my complaint in to the MTA and will continue to pursue this matter until she is taken off her post. This route, her route in the morning picks up many families, kids and older adults. I fear for the safety of people while she is still out there driving and the unfortunate passengers who I am sure have suffered whiplash the way she drives her bus. Imagine how many people she has done this to. How many parents and kids she has victimized.
