After being seated, the waiter hands you a menu with the two options on it. (Afternoon or High Tea), the difference outside of $10 is you get a \"main dish\" option with High Tea. Once you choose the one you want, your tea is brought out with your \"food\". We found it a nice array of tea sandwiches and desserts and it filled us up to our surprise. We were never rushed to finish quickly and got the experience we came there for. The area you're eating in is a tad cramped if full (which it was when we went), but somehow we still felt like we had our own section to talk amongst ourselves. You may have to maneuver a bit past some people in chairs to get from your table to the bathroom though. Also, I'm not sure if it's very Accessible since I didn't notice an elevator anywhere and again, the dining area is small. There is a private dining area I noticed in the back so they probably do small private parties.  Being candid, I did find the scones a little dry and maybe cooked a little too long, but it wasn't a big enough problem to cause us to not enjoy it. If you're in NYC, and want to try Afternoon Tea, you should give it a try! It's one of the more affordable Tea experiences."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Visited here on a girls trip and we were not disappointed!

They will refill your hot water at your request and mostly leave you alone unless you need something. I didn't feel rushed, which was nice. They can accommodate a vegetarian menu and a gluten free menu with 24 hour notice. They subbed out my salmon item for a vegetarian option since I don't eat seafood, which was lovely! They cannot really accommodate vegans or those with nut allergies though. It was a bit chilly by the back glass doors.\n\nLooks like they serve Harney & Sons brand teas exclusively. Their alcoholic drinks looked good. Smaller side portions but you can add on an entree for an extra $10, which was pretty tiny FYI. I personally thought it was enough food but I drank 2 pots of tea and have a smaller appetite than most of my friends. Cute cozy cottage/hunter's cabin decor. Bathroom was clean. The (owner's?) dog in the front was hiccupping all night, which was so cute. $60 after tax and tip.
