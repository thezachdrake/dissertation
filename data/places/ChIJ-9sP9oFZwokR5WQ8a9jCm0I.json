I had two children at the time, so I was getting a good chunk back , of course I didn’t know any better. I paid that amount for five freaking years. Of course H&R Block also charges a very high amount but could you imagine if the tax preparer did this to every person with just 10 people alone she would be making a whopping $4000 imagine the more the merrier right!
