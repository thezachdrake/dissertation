I had been with my prior OB for 13 years, so I was very apprehensive about the switch.\n\nFrom the first visit, my mind was completely set at ease. Dr. Zork is firstly, very well-versed on the latest research and best practice and highly intelligent. Further, she has a caring, calm, and professional demeanor. She really listens to her patients and is open to their views and many questions. She was never rushed and she remembered everything we had discussed.\n\nThis was my second pregnancy and it ended up being more complicated than expected (1) it largely occurred during a pandemic, (2) I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and (3) I developed a breast abscess at 34 weeks. During all of these challenges, Dr. Zork offered a standard of care that went above and beyond what was required of her. She supported me when I wanted to try to control my GD via diet but eventually we couldn't keep my fasting blood glucose down, so she painstakingly explained the implications of high blood glucose, the need for insulin, and the approach that we would be taking.\n\nWhen my breast abscess presented, I contacted her and she called and basically begged a breast surgeon to see me immediately. There is no way I would have even known where to start to get help. The abscess persisted and she called again to get me more help. I ended up having surgery postpartum and had to stop breastfeeding and Dr. Zork did research to find a course of action to help with that process. During a very emotional time, she was responsive, resourceful, and supportive!\n\nThe birth of my daughter went off without a hitch. I had to be induced due to the GD and Dr. Zork walked me through, several times, exactly what was going to happen. She endeavored to put me at ease after I had had a very long induction with my first child. Her partners who assisted during the birth and who I saw for one visit prior to birth, were exceptional as well. The hospital stay, even during Covid times, was really good. All the nurses, pediatricians, and support staff were efficient and effective.\n\nTo conclude, the practice, from the front office staff, to the nurses, to the doctors, is just great.
