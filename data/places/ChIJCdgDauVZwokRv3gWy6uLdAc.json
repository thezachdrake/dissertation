The service was really friendly and helpful with the questions we had, and the flavors were unique and tasty! I had the snap pea Caesar salad which was decent, but I did really like how they added mint to that dish to make it pop. I also had the sausage and cheese pizzas, both of which I thought were good. I liked the cheese pizza better than the sausage because it had a lighter taste, but I did like both of them. Overall a really neat little spot in the heart of Union Square!
