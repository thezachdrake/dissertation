On 6/15/23 I received a reply from guest services with an email address from the hotel which forwarded the thread requesting feedback on my concerns.

I asked Mrs. Sonn following my last call on 6/21/23 who she reported to, she said she only reports to Hilton and if I had issues with her to contact them, as we can see this isn’t who she works for and her reluctance to be honest further irritates me to reach out to you. The hospitality business doesn’t need people who won’t do the right thing, and this as you know will negatively impact your brand. I would like some type of reply letting me know you have received my message.
