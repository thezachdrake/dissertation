The vehicle I have is commercial with a monthly parking account with them. 6 months ago  it was damaged by their staff while at the parking both sides at the back serious scratches obviously made by trying to fit the car in too narrow spot. I was told that they don’t deal with this from the parking and I have to submit a claim and they will contact me from another department. I submitted the claim and tried to call numerous times leaving messages and sending emails and when I finally got an email back the only thing I got is that they had not received  the claim and I had to resend it again.  Once I did that like right away the only answer I got is that they have received it and then no answer to any of my emails or voice messages for like 6 months already. You’ll ask me why did I leave my car there after that... wells Simply because I’m literally stacked with work and didn’t have the time to go find another parking hoping that eventually they will fix the damages.  Now 6 months later they damaged the car again but this time very very badly at the front. This time it’s so bad the whole bumper needs to be changed. All damages are probably over $2000 cost and all I’m getting is that they are not responsible but they are there for me to talk to but they don’t deal with this and I have to submit a new claim and the same story again. I don’t understand if they have cameras and they can easily see who did the damages from their staff how come they are doing exactly nothing about it telling me that they are not responsible for this and that I have to contact somebody else that never answers the phone or the emails and messages that are left. This is soooo outrageously unprofessional,  I just feel like people should be warned what to expect if they park their car there."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the worst parking ever and if you can I would say never leave your car there!
