They were both incredibly helpful, informative, and patient throughout the entire leasing process. Once I settled into my new apartment, I was immediately impressed by the soundproof walls and windows, which made for a quiet and peaceful living environment. The views of the Hudson River are breathtaking and never fail to impress. I also appreciate the fact that the gym and amenities spaces are not ever crowded. The Verizon internet service is fast and reliable, making it easy to work from home. I also love having a gas stove and full-sized appliances in the apartment, and the closets and doors are sturdy and well-constructed, which is a big plus compared to other apartments (heavy duty hinges versus the common cheap white closet door constructions - if you’ve toured the area you know what i’m talking about). The A/C and heating have been functioning without any issues (we replaced the stock thermostat with a Nest - works great!) and the shower pressure is fantastic with hot water always available. Recessed lighting in throughout is awesome and also have had no problems with drinking tap water. Trash chute rooms are emptied/cleaned daily and kept in very nice condition. Last but not least, the doormen are extremely friendly and always greet residents by name, making you feel welcome and appreciated. Overall, I am extremely happy with my decision to move here and highly recommend this apartment complex to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean NY living experience.\n\nP.S.
