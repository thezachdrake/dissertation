The Beef was rich, buttery flavor, and tender. Then you get that kick of the creamy and salty flavor of the cheese. We loved it! Then add onions and bell peppers, and add a crunchy and slightly sweet taste to it too! As for the American, Wagyu Roast Beef was juicy and succulent. The beef just melts in the mouth. It was satisfying compared to any other type of roast beef. Lastly, we enjoyed the American Wagyu Slaw Be Jo with the coleslaw which contributed a crunchy and slightly sweet taste.
