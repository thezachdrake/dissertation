I chose the east coast and they were just okay something about them just didn’t seem too fresh. Once my wine arrived, I put in an order for a chicken sandwich. By this time the place was much more crowded and I could tell people sitting beside me were getting agitated about how long it was taking for their drinks to arrive. My sandwich was prompt and arrived less than 10 minutes from when I put in my order. Unfortunately I was disappointed, it just had an overwhelming taste of “fried”. Not much flavor at all even though there was some kind of spicy mayo on it. Seems the chicken or breading itself was not seasoned at all. The best part of my meal was the french fries and wine (which can be had anywhere). For a small meal that came out to $70 for one person, I was extremely underwhelmed. Unfortunately I won’t be retuning."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Got there around 5:45 on a sunny Thursday evening.
