He sent me some paperwork to fill out so I called my insurance to ask about the Claim ID, they helped and mentioned I have three EAP visits that my company covers that I can also add in the section. Pio accepts EAP so I thought nothing of it and put both numbers in the paperwork and sent them along. I sent the form a week ago. Last night he emails me complaining about the EAP. I replied I wasn't aware and if possible he can charge my regular ID number instead. When we join our Zoom call I remind him about the \"no video\" that we discussed during consultation and he responds he won't be able to move forward because he thought that was just for the initial call which he also thought I was taking during working hours. Which was very odd being that it was Saturday and I don't work on the weekends. I followed up on the email with his refusal to work with me because I could not be on video do to my religious beliefs and he replied calling stating I withheld information. The EAP? In the end Im grateful it happened because I do not want that type of person as my therapist.\nUpdate: he’s even sent me two follow up emails about my review stating I’m spreading “poisonous venom” and seeking therapy isn’t something I would want my employers to know. Such an odd thing for a therapist to say.\nLuckily I’m not embarrassed because it should be normalized.\n\n(Update: thanks for reply 😌 but I’m not a “victim”.
