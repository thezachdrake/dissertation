International artists beware - even though they are your petitioner, Fringe does not support you through the Visa process and does not have any rules/deadlines regarding this process. What neither Fringe or their recommended lawyer will tell you is that even if you submit all of your documents on time, you may not receive Visa approval/denial until 3 weeks/one month before the festival. This means you're taking a huge risk financially as Fringe expects you to prepare for the festival without Visa approval. We brought up our concerns over their lawyer not submitting our Visas according to agreed upon deadlines many times and were brushed off, encouraged to stay in the festival and \"trust the process.\" At one point, Fringe and the lawyer seemed to have lost our visa application, with each stating the other had it, for over a month's time.\n\nOur worst fears came true when our Visa ended up being delayed and we lost a ton financially. Fringe initially offered us a partial refund and then ignored us, we had to file a dispute with our credit card company to get the money back. We tried to file a complaint with their board of directors and never heard anything back, highly unprofessional, poorly run, and  heartless organization.\n\nIf you're going to participate in this as an international artist, I strongly advise getting your own lawyer, setting your own deadlines, and to not incur any additional costs until you get your Visa approval well in advance (no matter what Fringe and their lawyer tell you - and they'll be dismissive/non-responsive, and will string you along). Local artists  may have had a more positive experience, but international artists (all of us that year, 2018) were put in the highly stressful position of preparing for the festival without Visa approval, and were seemingly forgotten about when it came to helping us through the process, addressing concerns, adhering to timelines, and being 100% honest with us on the implications of Visa denial. We felt strung along and scammed, truly one of the most devastating (financial and otherwise) experiences of my life. Good luck and be careful."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Sharing my experience in case there are international (artist) participants in the future.
