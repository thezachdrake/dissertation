It helped me to connect to that which gives people the chance to do what they need, trust to help them get to the place of stability truth and acceptance. Security to do what I  needed to help family and friends and to take care of my most important goals and focus. To trust and keep focused on loving ways to help. At that time five years ago Chelsea Mini Storage provided shipping services to clients and sold moving supplies in an office space with an entrance on 12th Avenue in the same building. It helped me and other people that used this service and signed an agreement to do it trust that their possessions could be shipped from and to the facility using UPS or US Mail and will get to their desired destination safely. That boxes shipped there were held in safekeeping safely until the customer could physically come to take care of it.  My experience as a customer who had a storage unit there is that is one that helps me trust the benevolence of New York City people and helping them to do what they need to get to where they are going. Equality and self sufficiency. Sobriety. Life on life’s terms. There is a great security system in place with 24 hour camera recording and elevators with a security officers on each floor and also automatic lighted walkways. The storage specialists that I had the pleasure of working with were kind understanding customer service oriented and always available to help me during one of the most stressful and challenging times of my life. There are dollies and hand carts available and people to help that one  needs to sign in to maintain security for the customers there. There were always rules and standards enforced for protection safety and peace of mind. I recall there was a vending machine on site and a walkway that connects the storage unit facility to the space where the shipping and moving supply office was. There is access to the building amenities that at the time in August and September 2014 helped me to stay hydrated and connected to life and good. Thanks to God and by the grace of God I will always do what I can to help promote this place.
