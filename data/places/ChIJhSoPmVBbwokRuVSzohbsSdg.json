But when you find agencies that offer legal services to those that meet the criteria you think you are able to see some light within the storm.\n\nSo I contact NYC Bankruptcy Project and schedule an appointment to attend a mandatory workshop which is basically a breakdown of the services they do or do not offer. At the end of the workshop there are a few legal assistants and/or pro bono attorneys that meet with you, review your documentation and assess whether or not you meet the criteria for their services.\n\nMy appointment was 6/8/16. I submitted all my documentation and was told that I met the criteria and was accepted to receive services to file for bankruptcy. The next step was to wait to be contacted in order to set up another appointment to start the process. The contact person was Stephanie Miranda(Bankruptcy Paralegal).\n\nAfter about a month I send Ms. Miranda an email to follow up and I got no response. Another week goes by and I contact her by phone. I explained that I hadn't heard anything and I just wanted to follow up. She stated that she will contact the attorney that is assigned to the case and I should be hearing from him in about a week or so. A week goes by and nothing. Another week goes by and still nothing. I shoot Ms. Miranda an email and again no response. So I had to call her again. I basically had to repeat everything and remind her she said the attorney would contact me within a week, 3 weeks ago. She indicated she would contact him again and if I don't hear anything I should call back. Annnnnnd a week later I'm calling Ms. Miranda back. It's now 8/31/16. She explains that the attorney had some type of emergency and was out of town for a few weeks. I let her know that I understand that my case is Pro Bono and I know it's not a top priority but I was basically looking for some reassurance that my case was going forward.\n\nI am now provided with the contact information of the assigned attorney. Mr.  William Corso. I sent him an email and he contacted me withing a couple hours. He did explain to me that he was out of state on a family emergency which I understood. As I explained to Ms. Miranda I just wanted to make sure it was still getting done considering the time that had passed. He said yes and apologized several times. But it was cool. I was relieved to finally have contact with him and be told that we are moving forward.\n\nThe next step, as it was explained to me was that he needed to do some type of conflict search to make sure that his law firm is not already representing one of the creditors that were after me. That made perfect sense to me. So I sit back an wait. One week, two weeks and on the third week I contacted Mr. Corso to follow up. Again he apologized several times and indicated that he still hadn't check for the conflicts. He then asked me if I received anything new in the mail from any of the creditors. In which I did.  He told me to email it over to Ms. Miranda ASAP, he will do the conflict search and I should be scheduled to come in the following week to START the paperwork.\n\nA week goes by and I shoot an email:\n\"Hey William, just wanted to follow up and see how you are making out with the search\" and he responded \"Scott,  I should have final confirmation tomorrow.  I will give you a call then.\" It's now 10/3/16.\n\nI'm running out of characters for this review so I'll wrap it up with this. Mr. Corso never called or responded to me again after several more attempts to contact him.
