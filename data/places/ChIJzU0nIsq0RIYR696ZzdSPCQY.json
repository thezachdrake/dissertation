She has also helped me expand my network by helping set up informational interviews with professionals in different fields (this has been SO useful).\n\nI also have to say that Alexa is so incredibly kind and empathetic, and I am so grateful for how empowered she helped me feel at a time when I was at a real low.  She truly listens and hears you, which is crucial.
