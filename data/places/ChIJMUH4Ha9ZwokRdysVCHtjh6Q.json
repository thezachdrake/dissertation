That's sort of a good thing. Being that you don't get to go ALL out, it keeps you aware, keeps you focus.\n\nWhere and how you stand on this scooter is very important. To me it didn't feel like I had enough surface to stand on or in. It feels awkward, like I'm not totally on the board, like there isn't enough room. It doesn't feel comfortable. But I guess that is alright because I'm not going that great of a distance I suppose.\n\nIn Gear 1,it was sort of a surprise when the scooter 'Leaped' forward. I got use to that fast. The 'push off' in gear1 is okay...but  doing it in 2 or 3... I had to prepare myself. The take off is VERY impressive. I started in Gear 3, it's okay...but still can see it getting away from me if I'm not paying attention.\n\nBraking. This too is... scared me. I used the hand break, I don't or didn't feel comfortable using the foot break. I felt I was steeping off the scooter using the foot break. If I have to stop on a dime, the hand break WILL do that. The deceleration is remarkable. I LOVE IT!!\n\nSpeed. WOW!!  I don't know what the top speed is for this model, but I do know I hit 17mph. On a flat road, I got up to 21 mph. I went from 15 mph to 12 mph going up a VERY steep hill, which I get out of breath JUST walking up it. I will have to purchase a helmet with a visor, it goes fast enough, that wind speed becomes a visual problem for me. I also notice something... In gear 3, it 'downshifted' to gear 2 when I slowed down. Was/is that possible? Also...can I change gears on the fly, like when I'm actually in motion, is possible?\n\nConsumption... That night I went pedal to the metal for about 1 mile, no change in the battery. I went 2.4 miles, and battery decreased by one bar. Though I'm still going to carry the charging plug with me everywhere I go.\n\nI LOVE this scooter... Just wished that for the models that are  sort worn and torn that they send out.. I wished there was a Rent to Own on these models. I would be willing to pay $10 a month on insurance with a Rent to Own Model, if there was one. The E500 is what..3 years old? I STILL would suggest using this product thjough.\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nSo about over a week ago, I get a text message asking would I like to save a certain percent off of the E500 I was renting. Sure. My November payment..about $41. Wow. I mean even though I live in Virginia, we did get a good amount of snow... I really didn't feel like turning in my scooter, and then renting it out again come the Spring. Discount on payments is up until April 2024.\n\nThen about 15 minutes later, I get another text... The e350, refurbished...$199. I thought about it. I hope come December it would still be at that price. So I sent the text to my sister. She texted back...'Do you want it as a Christmas gift? Sure. It was delivered yesterday in the 27th.\n\nBut it isn't the e350, it's the e500, refurbished. Wow!! I Love this scooter. Being that the tired are airless, it makes me be MORE aware when I'm riding. Believe it or not, 18 to 20 miles an hour is pretty fast...without a helmet..for a 63 year old.\n\nI've had it for 3 months, and I have 224 miles clocked on it. I think the cold weather effects the battery. Because going up hill, one  bar tucked off. Going downhill, the battery was dead and it was beeping. Turned it off in the store and powered back out when I went outside... Battery had one bar tucked off. No beeping, good to go. I think I'm going to purchase a helmet for myself for Christmas.
