Spent quite a bit of time on the store’s website looking at their offerings, but at the time of my visit I was being paid only in cash and opted to stop by instead of going through the hassle of depositing $$.\n\nI stopped by the next day after my shift and immediately upon stepping in the door and greeting the woman working the counter— an old white woman— she gave me an extreme glare, no greeting and sneered “you need to leave.”\n\nI was taken aback and asked her to repeat herself: she then instead asked my age. I’m twenty. She asked if I had ID. I don’t carry my wallet with me to work (long story), so I told her I didn’t, but that (my friend’s name) had told me to check out the store. She then told me very harshly and flippantly that she didn’t care who sent me, get out and that no one underage is allowed in the store, there’s a 21+ policy. VERY rude and hostile the entire time, treated me like less than nothing.\n\nI had no idea there was any kind of 21+ policy at Purple Passion previous to this. I haven’t experienced something like this anywhere else in NYC. I operate under the assumption that all sex stores have an 18+ policy unless stated otherwise. It’s nowhere on this listing. There’s also absolutely nothing on the website.\n\nI’m aware that as a transgender man I can appear much younger than I am. If she had gently explained that there’s some kind of 18+ policy I would have just returned the next day with ID. If I’d been politely informed of a harsh in store 21+ policy I would’ve just left and gone about my day. Instead I was treated as if I was some 14-year old troublemaker coming to laugh instead of a customer ready to drop a substantial amount of money on leatherwear, blatantly making it obvious that she did not believe me to be of age. I’m not typically picky about customer service but this was really an appalling experience. I understand checking the ID of anyone who appears underage, but the level of disrespect was unwarranted.\n\nIf there had been some kind of Terms and Conditions on the website that clearly stated a 21+ policy, I wouldn’t have come all the way across Manhattan and wasted my time being disrespected. I’m of legal age. I’ve bought kink gear for years. I would gladly take my business elsewhere.
