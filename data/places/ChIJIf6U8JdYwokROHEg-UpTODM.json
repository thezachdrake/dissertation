You never feel like just a number there, but rather a special individual who is looked at in whole and not just statistically according to age or other factors of the sort. The environment of the office is so relaxed and calming, you feel like you are sitting in a beautiful brownstone rather then a Dr office. I don't think I've ever been in the waiting area with more then just one other person at a time and often I was the only one waiting. I always appreciated that they did not overbook appointments, again giving me the feeling of being an individual rather then a number. The front desk staff is very kind and definitely on top of things. When you send them an email in regards to appointments or tests or anything, they are very efficient in getting back that same day or if after hours, you can expect to hear from them first thing the next morning. Dr David is a gem. Such a compassionate, caring Doctor. He is just great to work with and truly listens to all my needs and addresses them accordingly. He is very skilled and knowledgeable with difficult fertility situations. He always made me feel calm and right on track whenever I freaked out about where I was in my fertility journey. He goes above and beyond for his clients. He is a pleasure to work with. His nurse Jessica has been wonderful and caring as well and I appreciate the whole staff of Fifth Avenue Fertility. I can't say enough good things so i will just sum it up with saying, I'm so happy I found them💜"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have had a great experience with Fifth Avenue Fertility and continue to do so.
