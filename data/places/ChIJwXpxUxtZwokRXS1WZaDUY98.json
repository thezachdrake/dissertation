He cut ahead of drivers that were being respectful of traffic laws, drivers that were being orderly and patient and not losing their cool in what was a backlog of cars waiting to turn, and then he cuts off cars trying to go straight through the intersection so that he can turn.  Upon seeing me photographing him, the driver, who was in such a hurry up to this point, suddenly found the time to stop his truck in the middle of the intersection, get out, and come towards me yelling and threatening me.  This is the guy that  was just driving in the wrong lane, cutting cars off,  endangering cyclist, pedestrians, and other cars, now yelling at me as if I did all of that.  The anger was apparent, his temper completely out of control, his behavior inexcusable.  He backed off when he realized that I was not shrinking away from him, got back in his truck, and speed away.  Later, I called the company to report the incident as I would want someone to tell me about an employee of mine that acted like this.  This sort of employee is a liability to any company and hurts a company's image.  When I called I asked to speak with the owner  and someone was put on the phone who said he was the owner.  The man was immediately defensive and I believe it was because he was one and the same as driver of the truck in question, and he remembered the incident.  I did not feel he was listening to me and told him so.  His response was to talk over me and show the same sort of hot temper as the driver I had witnessed.  I decided that the best thing I could do is report the incident through appropriate channels and through social media.
