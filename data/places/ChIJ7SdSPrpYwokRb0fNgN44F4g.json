If you have a history of abuse or trauma, I would recommend thinking twice before contacting Dr. Budney. From my experience, initially she came off as caring/empathetic/sincere, but I felt red flags that no one is really that sincere- it was too extreme, that it felt inauthentic. I went against my better instincts, but later found the truth- that she does not care, that she is not reliable, that she lies and fails to follow-through on her promises. To me, she is not safe. I wish I hadn't ever met with her as my experience with her makes it even harder for me to try and trust a new therapist- she added to the trauma that I was already experiencing.\n\nOne additional note, she works out of a studio apartment- so there is no waiting room. I think it's typical to show up to an appointment at least 5-10 minutes early to make sure you are not late (and especially because you are paying so much), but there is absolutely no place for you to wait. I would try to time it so that I would get there as close to the time of my appointment as possible.  Even when I arrived 2 minutes early once, she let me in and asked me to get settled, but commented that I was early. Another time when I arrived slightly early (maybe 5-10 minutes before my scheduled time) she was with another patient. It's currently winter and I had nowhere to stand except in the entryway to the apartment building with residents needing to pass by me- it was awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nI hope this review is helpful for others.
