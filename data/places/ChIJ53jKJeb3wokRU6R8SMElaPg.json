Wanted to take home this off-white nice fleece warm up suit that I reallywant. After purchasing the suit, the cashier could not get the security tags off the top. The saleswoman who rang up my purchase ask another saleswoman go up upstairs and see if another top was available in the same color. The top was available but not in the size I needed. After waiting for 20 minutes and 4 women trying to get the tag off. I just hobbled back to the area, I found the same off white fleece outfit. Because I am on crutches, and searched the racks and found a powder blue suit. Same style, and size, but a different color. I feel the customer service was not there. This time the security tags came off after the exchange was done.While the saleswoman was searching she could have said I don't see an off white set, but I see a power blue one.\nThe manager didn't even offer to order the same suit online or have the suit delivered to my house or the store. I ended up exchanging the off-white top and pants for the powder blue one. I feel something should have been given like a discount on the exchange or a free lip gloss. I normally don't shop for clothes at Victoria Secret's. I shop at Lane Bryant because the saleswomen go out their way to find clothes for you if they are not on the floor. Whether it's in another color, size, and that's what I  LOVE about Lane & Bryant.
