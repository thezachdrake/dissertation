I arrived at my appointment for 3pm and the staff was really pleasant to talk with. They signed me in and went right in to get worked on no waiting around. The staff that did my X-ray was professional and gentle with me. Then the doctor came in and went over my X-ray and a quick check and told me exactly what has to get done and gave me options for the future. I then proceeded over to get my cleaning done and let me tell you she was the best I didn’t even flinch once. She was professional, gentle and I can tell from her performance she really enjoy and takes pride in her work.
