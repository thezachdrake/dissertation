While the older lady who attended to us was wonderful, I encountered an unpleasant situation with another younger employee that left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nUpon entering the cafe, my wife and I noticed a customer waiting for assistance while a young employee on the picture, was engaged in a casual conversation with a technician. We patiently waited for nearly 10 minutes, hoping the employee would acknowledge the waiting customer and provide the necessary assistance. Unfortunately, the young employee ignored the customer completely, displaying a lack of professionalism and disregard for other people's time.\n\nFeeling increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, I politely approached the young employee and informed her that there was a customer who had been waiting for quite some time. To my surprise, her response was incredibly disrespectful and she showed no regard for the customer's time or the importance of providing quality customer service. She bluntly stated that she would not assist the customer until she finished her conversation.\n\nIt is disheartening to encounter such behavior from an employee working in a front desk position. While I appreciate the products offered by Tres Leches Cafe, which is the best on New York in my opinion, it is evident that the owners need to hire individuals with better interpersonal skills and a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.
