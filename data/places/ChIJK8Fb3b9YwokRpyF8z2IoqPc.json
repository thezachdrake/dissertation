This is my 2nd time coming here and they did a better job this time around. I love the way Emily did my nails, she put a lot of effort into getting the shape right without me having to tell her. I had gotten galaxy nails, these are metallic nailpolish that you would use a magnet after applying to pull the shine to the top. I got them on my toes and fingers, the whole process took 2 hours since I had gotten tips. When I went up to pay the manager/owner told me it was going to be a total of $195, I asked for a breakdown and she said it was all special nail polish and then the design would cost extra too. 4 little clouds cost $10. Okayyyy. My pedicure came out to $80, she said it was because of the special nail polish, I didn't get a special pedicure, no spa or callous removal. Everything seemed a bit overpriced but the kicker was when I told her I will be giving $20 as a tip. She looked at me and said we do at least 15% tip. So she put $30 extra on my card to account for the tip. All together coming out to $225.\nI would like to come back to this place but it's quite pricey. She tried to tell me it will be definitely cheaper next time because I'll only be doing a filler. That makes sense. Everyone was very nice and helpful, she didn't make a scene about me asking for the breakdown, the only thing I didn't really agree with was telling me what tip I had to pay."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I really want to like this place.
