I work for an agency and when it comes to over time they play like they can't see the HHA system, so why even do home care if you don't know how to get into system..... This is the 2nd time they haven't authorized an over time for me. I wasn't going to write a review but I'm tired of them playing with money. I don't work for free it took them almost 7 months to give the woman I work for extra hrs and her condition changed multiple times... And the nurse Linda played like she never saw the discharge papers. I hope the owner see's this review and I will be making a trip to the office. Since they never get my agencies faxed documents or the changes in the system..... This has to stop they don't care about people.... I have bills to pay... I don't work for free if we get stuck in Manhattan or long land traffic or at an appointment because there was an issue.... I'm still on the clock I don't clock out until I get her home, something to eat and in her home safe........."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This place is a complete joke.
