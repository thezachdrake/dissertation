I've worked with some pretty incompetent companies, but this one was by far the worst. If you make the mistake to rent from them, be prepared to have your packages stolen, calls ignored, repairs left unmended, and time wasted. They can't do something as simple as pick up a phone. When it comes to problem solving, they're like children, having to hand things off to their boss as soon as the conversation steers towards even a hint of conflict. That would be fine if their boss was capable of doing anything, but Milton (you know, the owner of the property) claims he has no responsibility over the buildings common areas and no control over the maintenence. They do this funny thing where they say they need to get into the basement to solve every problem, which according to them they need the maintenance people for. Don't ask me how the owner of the building doesn't have a key to the basement. If anything happens to a package (which it will, multiple times) be prepared to get police involved as the folks at Davis Realty refuse to check their camera, which according to them doesn't work, even though the light is constantly on. When I was renting from Davis Realty, maintenence became a really unfunny ongoing joke. Fun fact, Davis Realty actually employs the Loch Ness monster for repairs. The man does not exist. You can call twenty times, don't expect anything to get fixed. I'm convinced they pulled a Weekend at Bernie's and found some poor stiff that looked vaguely like a repairman, waved him around for a week around when I was touring, then gave up the act. All jokes aside, Davis Realty is a miserable business and renting from them was awful. Don't do it. Find yourself a better apartment with better owners."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Renting from Davis Realty was a nightmare.
