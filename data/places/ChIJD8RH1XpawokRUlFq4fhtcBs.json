A Google search brought us to Blazing Saddles and we found it very convenient to book our bikes online in advance of our visit.\n\nWe arrived at Governors Island around 8:35 am on this past Sunday morning.  The walk to the Blazing Saddles rental tent was less than five minutes.  Though we arrived before its official opening, there was someone at the front desk who was happy to check us in and get us our bikes.  We rented Island Cruisers for the entire day for a price of $30 which seemed fair.  We even spent the optional $5 per bike for insurance which I don't think was really needed but gave us peace of mind against any potential accidents that included damage.\n\nThe bikes were in excellent shape.  One of the extras we asked for were bike locks which they don't automatically throw in unless you ask for them (no extra charge).   These locks came in handy as we stopped several times around the island to do some exploring.\n\nBiking around Governors Island was incredibly fun.  Since we started our trek early in the morning, we felt as if we had the entire island to ourselves.  However, as the day progressed, it became quite crowded, the amount of bikers increased, and we found ourselves having to dodge around the influx of riders.  By 1 pm in the afternoon we felt it had become too crowded to enjoy biking further and we returned our rentals.  Upon the return, a rep asked us if we had a good time and we resounded with a huge, \"yes!\"\n\nIf you are considering a 2-hour rental or an entire day, I would recommend a full day.  You can absolutely ride the entire island and its inner pathways within 2 hours.  However, that 2 hours goes very quickly and if you want to stop and explore or have something to eat, that's time taken away from your bike ride.  I think having the luxury of having the bike all day for slightly more than the hourly rate is the way to go.\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic experience with Blazing Saddles.  They were extremely friendly, made the rental process effortless, and provided us with bikes that were in excellent shape.  We are looking forward to doing this again in the fall."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"What an outstanding experience with Blazing Saddles!\n\nMy girlfriend and I had decided months ago that we wanted to go spend some time in New York City and do some bike riding around Governors Island.
