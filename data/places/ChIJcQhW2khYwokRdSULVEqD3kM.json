Think of her only in terms of the engineering challenges her designers ultimately overcame and that she could make the run between NYC and London in 3 hours (the record a few minutes less than that). And consider that this marvelous---if extremely expensive to build, fly and operate---aircraft was designed and built in the 1960s, flew in '69 and began regularly flying passengers in the mid-1970s, wow. She is beautiful to walk around, which is included with your general admission but everyone that loves aviation should at least once buy a ticket to walk through her. True, the leather seats are lovely but the real treat I remember was the complexity of the flight deck (see photo). So many analog switches, felt like it was double the number of a standard jetliner of the '70s.
