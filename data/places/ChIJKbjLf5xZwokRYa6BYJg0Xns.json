Easy to pick out what you want, without having to take 900 years to look through a huge menu. This menu is to the point, and just helps anyone who usually might be indecisive.\n\nSince it's a simple menu, I felt that the food we had ordered came out exceptionally good. A lot of attention to detail, taste and texture. It was enjoyable to look at and filling!! I had a full stomach and it was great.\n\nThe atmosphere is club-like. Dim lighting with some colorful strip lights. Super cool, in my opinion. There are also mahjong tables on the ceiling, so make sure to look up!! I liked how the bathroom was super clean and well maintained, very unique. By far one of the best bathrooms I have seen at a restaurant yet. Unfortunately it's only one stall, so make sure you go before a line develops.\n\nThe seating is a bit uncomfortable. I was at this location for about an hour and a half or so, and my bottom felt numb after a while. The seats are these plastic high stools, which is interesting but not the most comfortable.. might want to bring a cushion. Tables are small, so beware, you may knock something over if you aren't careful. Seating is limited and can be hard to move around in when it gets crowded. Try to go before the dinner rush if you can.\n\nOverall, I had a really nice time. Food was great, staff was friendly and attentive. Aesthetics were 10/10. Just need to improve the seating arrangement, as well as maybe adding some cushions in the seats. I highly recommend 886.
