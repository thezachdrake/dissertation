Seating gets tighter spaced as you go towards the top. The very top has both seating and standing area. There's a bar on board where you can get alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages. There are several bathrooms. You can bring your own snacks or drinks on board. The trip was super efficient, 35 minutes each way. They provide shuttle services at the destination, which are on time and efficient. At first I thought the price tag was high for the round trip ticket, but later when I saw the boat and the process and enjoyed the experience, I realized it was completely worth the price tag. I would definitely do this trip again in a heartbeat. I would also consider doing the whale watch or other routes with this company.
