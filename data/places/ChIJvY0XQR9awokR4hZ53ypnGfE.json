The patty was flavorful and had a great texture, which is often hard to find in vegetarian options. I was impressed by the fresh vegetables and condiments that complemented the patty perfectly.\n\nWhat stood out for me was the service and the staff's understanding of specific dietary preferences.

It's always a relief to find a place that respects the dietary choices of its customers.\n\nSubway's New York City location provided a clean and welcoming environment, making my meal even more enjoyable.
