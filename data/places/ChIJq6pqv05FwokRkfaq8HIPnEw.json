The nurses there were angels, god bless them, but the doctors couldn't make her better and I believe they considered her untreatable (she'd been through a series of UTIs). Once home, your nurses came very quickly on those difficult days, and their care and concern was wonderful. I can only imagine how much more difficult it would have been had we been left to deal with her failing condition on our own. From the initial consultation months before, when you said she wasn't ready for hospice because she was responding to in home rehab and the possibility of improvement was still there, to the end when your doctor came very quickly, the time you spent with us was priceless. The information you so freely provided, at length and so many times, was extremely valuable in helping us understand and deal with the end of life process.
