My wedding would have been on May 20th this year. I am quite certain it would have been a beautiful wedding. I had not one, but two beautiful wedding gowns. My 5 bridesmaids had dresses just as beautiful as mine. We purchased our shoes. Hired a professional group of hairstylist and makeup artist. We paid for everything. My fiance, Jonathan, purchased his tuxedo, as did his 5 groomsmen. Family members purchased airline tickets. Everything was in place for my wedding day to be just what we envisioned it to be. Sadly, my fiance will not get to see me in my dresses. I won't see him in his tux. Our bridal party will not don their dresses and tuxedos either. On May 20th, because of Alex Taveras company, MP Events, I will find myself thinking of what might have been because my wedding had to be cancelled.\n\nMy fiance and I work very hard. We are both also students. We worked hard and saved our money to be able to pay for our wedding. We met, hired, and entrusted Alex with our wedding, our future, and our money. To say that was a mistake would be an understatement. It is gone. Every last penny of the $7,000 we handed him is gone. We have questioned him repeatedly about our money, and he can not provide us with an answer that makes sense other than to say, I used it on other weddings and things. Our money, he says, was used on other weddings. I can't even begin to understand that. Our money. He attempt to pay us back and gave us a $500 check, which had no funds in the account and then he proceed to give us $400 in cash...smh Please take a moment to look at his reviews yourself and you will see that he has a history of bad reviews. This man promised to pay us back. We have the emails to prove it, and still he hasn't.\n\nAlex knows the truth. He sat in his old office last week where he was allowed to be on that day because other clients came to confront him. It was also on that day that he was given court papers. I have no need to lie. MY WEDDING DAY IS RUINED. He took our money to fund his trips to Las Vegas, and treat himself to a nice time. We have proof of everything.\n\nTo all of you whom are out there reading this and planning a wedding, DO NOT hire this man. Please, please listen to me. I have suffered an enormous amount of stress because of this individual. I have gotten sick. I can't function at times. Don't let him ruin your wedding as well. I am devastated knowing that in 60 days I was suppose to  marry the man I wanted to build a life with. Come May 20th I know Alex Taveras will not be giving me a second thought because he is heartless that way, but I, I will be thinking of him all day because of what he has done to me. I don't wish this on anyone. Please do not let him fool you like he did to me. My fiance, Jonathan M also posted his review. DO NOT HIRE ALEX TAVARES. He is a liar, and a crooked thief posing as a business person. He begged us to remove the review because he didn't wan't people to see it. We are not going to stand by and watch him lie to, and steal from other people.  I hope you will heed my warnings."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My name is Yesenia. My wedding would have been on May 20th this year.
