Plenty of vintage and contemporary architecture on that part of the trip. The food stops in Greenwich were great. Top shelf favorite food stop was Bleecker Street Pizza. Our absolute favorite thing about this tour was strolling through the West Village neighborhoods. Personally, I wish we had more time in those areas. The Jazz clubs are calling.
