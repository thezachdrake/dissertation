Dr Paddock then reviewed Neurology Eye images, Special Vision Tests and MRAs together with me.  Then step by step he provided explanation for my issues and recommended special care such as better moisturizing Eyedrops and even nutritional suggestions for aging healthier and outlined long term possibilities if Prescriptions and Glasses don't help.

For example, I learned why even though my eyes are full of tears, but I am still having this Dry Eyes syndrome problems causing issues with my vision and what needs to be done throughout the day for comfort and improving Eye Health.  He also explained unavoidable Age Related Eye Deseases and gave me advice on which issues I should be really just be patient using extra care for hygiene and getting enough moisture and the small diet tips which may provide relief and which issues might be the ones to worry about most and of course of the possibilities for future Eye Surgery when the time comes. I was also comforted by Dr Paddock as he noticed my fair about my eyes issues progressing.  He also demonstrated the difference between seemingly similar Eye Problems for some of the difficult to imagine symptoms which I was experiencing with Nerves or Muscles having vascular issues in not so long time ago past and my meds.
