I absolutely love that every time i see him i get the adjustment i need and come out of there feeling lighter. If you are looking for someone to really care about you and your body, that's him. Not someone that passes you along to someone else or rushes to get rid of you and just takes your money. Yes, he's more traditional when it comes to paperwork but the care he provides trumps all that.
