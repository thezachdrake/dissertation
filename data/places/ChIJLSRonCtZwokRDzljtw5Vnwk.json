I haven't gone downstairs to use them but it's nice to know they're available. When you arrive you check in, and it's right beside where you can pick up the cycling shoes to your size.

The music is very motivational. The instructor was cool, she seemed to be in-tuned with all the cyclist and making it encouraging for my pace.

I can say everyone was on track and on high energy. I was able to use my neighbor in front and next to me as a guide because it was a bit hard for me to hear the instruction and keep up.
