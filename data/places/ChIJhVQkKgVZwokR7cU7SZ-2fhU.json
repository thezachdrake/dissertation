I could hear all the young technicians (20s to 30) laughing and wandering around. Finally after that half an hour I found someone  and asked what was happened they said we are just preparing the room.  The room was ice cold as always I asked for a blanket.  They strapped cameras on me before a blanket.  I have had this mri before and never had additional cameras.  They tied the cameras on the very spot that was swollen  and jammed them down.  I asked to have them moved.  They kept hurting me with them. The headphones only worked on one side.  Then there was obviously something wrong with the machine they never turned it on until I was lying there for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  I have had many MRIS I know that the machine is supposed to go on immediately.  How did I know how long it was because 4 songs played on the radio it may even have been 20 minutes.  I came out 45 minutes after going in.  Way too long for a simple MRI without contast.  I have had this body part MRIed before and it takes from 20 to 25 minutes.
