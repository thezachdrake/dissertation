We didn't know what kind of Cactus it was because we know there are various different kinds of cactus but it was a nice option for a veggie taco. It had a slightly sour or acidic flavor, similar to green beans or okra. It was tasty overall. Our favorite was the Mexican Sausage Taco, it's always been our favorite and go-to taco. The Chorizo taco was savory and spicy, You never could go wrong with ordering a Chorizo taco. The Chicken Taco has a mild and savory flavor that was also juicy.
