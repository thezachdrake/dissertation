I filled those gave her back in few minutes. After waiting like 15 min, the nurses ask me few questions about my health and did my weigh height measurement. They were super nice to me. It was almost 4:00pm. Me and other lady was waiting for doctor Campusano but she never called any of us. I waited  upto 6 pm (2 hrs) just to talk with doctor. I asked receptionist that I have been waiting too long and then she mentioned still there is a person before me. Even after calling me, she was busy on phone. She was in rush. So after blood test I left this medical at 6:45pm. I spent like 3hrs 15 min just to talk with this doc.\nFor results they automatically made my appointment without even asking my schedule. I called back to change my appointment. This time my appointment was at 3pm. I checked in on time. Again I waited 2 and half hrs just to get back my reports. The people who came like 20 min late was called early and sent the report which is absolutely ridiculous. After waiting like 1 and half hour I asked the same receptionist why I am waiting this long just to get reports. I told her I will just leave if I have to wait any longer. She was angry at me and she was yelling at me telling its not her fault that doc is not calling me. I understand that but there is no need to yell at me for just asking a question. They even told that the company who analyze my test loose my test results and asked me to do the test. And after doing the test that they again told me company got the test and results will come back within few days which seems very unprofessional to me.\n\nPLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND DONOT GO TO THIS ABSOULTE RUBBISH PLACE WHO DOESNOT VALUE THE PLACE. ALL THE STAFFS ARE UNPROFESSIONAL  EXCEPT THE NURSES WHO DOES BLOOD TEST. THEY ARE SUPER NICE. THE RECEPTIONIST DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO REPLY AND WAS YELLING AT ME JUST TO ANSWER MY QUESTION. IF YOU CANNOT HANDLE THE PATIENT AND KEEP THEM WAITING FOR HOURS, DONOT ACCEPT THE APPOINTMENT. AN HOUR WAITING IS FINE BUT 3-4 HRS HOURS IS ABSOLUTELY DISCUSTING. THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME AND I WONT BE GOING BACK ON THIS RUBBISH PLACE. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN . AND THIS DOCTOR NEEDS TO TAKE SOME LESSONS RELATED TO IMPORTANT OF OTHERS TIME.
