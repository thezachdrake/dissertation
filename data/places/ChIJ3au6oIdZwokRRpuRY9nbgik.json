This place is packed, and also sell frozen dumplings, if you’d like to have them after hours. Our order came out within minutes. Note that seating is limited, and you might have to share a table with others, but everyone including customers are friendly and welcoming to sit with. When you enter, order at the counter in the back, then find a table. They call your order number out when it’s ready, with a tray and everything. Must eat in Chinatown!
