Within 2 min of looking at the menu I was approached twice with question if I’m ready to order which was clear I didn’t. Then I was asked if I have any questions about menu and then I said yes the waitress was not able to answer. Also I showed her the pic from Google review to find out the name of the dish and she was not able to tell me what it was (it was recent pic). She than asked about allergies which I told her I don’t have any and 30 seconds later she asked again the same question. So it was weird. Cook was preparing sushi right in front of me so I asked his a question what kind of fish it was. He answered first time but than called the waitress which than anyway asked him the same question cause she didn’t know the answer.\nNow the sushi experience. I liked everything. Fish was good and fresh, seaweed crispy which I liked especially. The only sushi I didn’t like was salmon row. Which had weird taste and was too “mushy”. The row and rice just all fell through the bottom, it was a mess.\nMiso soup was really good. Not salty like they usually serve which was nice. I also really like the salmon sushi with some sourness and crispy stuff on top. I agree with comments above that it could have a bit less rice but still tasted great.
