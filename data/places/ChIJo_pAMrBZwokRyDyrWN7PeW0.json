Pandora is high-end jewelry store and located in the heart of NYC, but that particular staff needs more training in terms of customer service and attitude. As a customer, I know what i had purchased is not expensive product perhaps did not contribute a significant amount of revenue to the store, so what? Does that mean I can not afford the more expensive ones? I own quite a few pieces from Cartier  and yes, I also buy Pandora and Swarovski to compliment my statement piece from Cartier. It makes me happy to sometimes turn to a less expensive luxury because I am convinced Pandora has a decent quality that can withstand the challenges of time and daily wear! I really do not like the way I was being treated or greeted as i was picking up my order that was only $35.00 which is a small pearl pendant! If the Management level ever sees my review please have a talk with the short lady and have her adjust her attitude a little bit, because little does she know, she might scare away many many potential customers. And a very warm Thank you to the young man who provided kind and patient attendance to me.
