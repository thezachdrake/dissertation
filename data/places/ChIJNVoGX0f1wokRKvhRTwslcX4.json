The nail tech seated in the 3rd chair serviced me. I asked her to shape my nails almond. *She did the dip first and shaped my nails after.* I've never had this order before so thought it strange.

The same nail tech was seated in the 3rd chair and serviced me. First red flag: she tried to just add glue. Second red flag: when I told her that wouldn't work, she started peeling off the polish with the cuticle clipper. I asked her not to do this as she'd damage my nails. She said that wouldn't happen as she was just peeling off the loose parts.\n\nShe didn't take the nail fully off and only filled in the pieces she peeled off. I've never had this done and assumed this might be standard and similar to getting a filling, but in reverse. She did this for the four nails that were lifting and added glue to the others. She didn't charge me for this, which is good because I wouldn't have paid. Fast forward one week, the polish on both index fingers broke off when I was out at an event. The other fingers she glued also started to lift off.\n\nMy last dip powder mani at a different salon lasted 6 weeks and I could have kept it for longer if not for the nail growth. *A dip powder mani lasting 2-7 days in completely unacceptable.* Despite the staff being nice, I'm utterly disappointed. Perhaps their other services have better outcomes or their other nail techs are more skilled, but I will never return or recommend as they wasted both my money and time.\n\nThis business has two Google Maps entries.
