I met with Jon for one month...2 to 3 times a week...focused and walked through problems and my score was raised 15 points within a month! He was so calm and patient and took his time explaining each problem.  He was able to pinpoint my weaknesses (reading comprehension!) and we walked through so many passages with tips and tricks.  We also did other LSAT sections too to strengthen areas I felt more confident in.  I am so happy I found him and chose him to tutor me.  We met through zoom just because it worked best logistically and honestly it was great.  He shares his whiteboard and puts up problems and you feel so at ease with the way he walks through problems.
