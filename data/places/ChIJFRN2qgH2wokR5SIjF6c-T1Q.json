The special education teacher was not friendly or engaging, she didn't look happy and she was young so I knew she didnt have alot of teaching experience. When I directed my concerns to the director her excuse was the teacher is young, this is her first teaching experience and she is Arab or East Indian so in their culture they are not outgoing and don't show emotion. I'm so glad they didn't want my son in their school because now his in a school as well in a integrated classroom who gave him a chance. His doing good Now after a couple of tough weeks.
