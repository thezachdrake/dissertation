For the lack a better word, the doctor’s reply shocks the conscience because instead of being professional and sympathetic to the cause, he doubles down and switches into defensive mode by stating that the “appointment wasn’t for treatment or diagnosis but a “medicolegal” exam”. It is evident that the doctor routinely diminishes the value of the so-called “medicolegal” exam. Goes without saying, he gets paid for each “missed” visit. Note that the doctor, in his review, withheld information that my brother was already in his office when he threatened to throw him out. No other medical professional would “throw a patient out” for being 23 minutes late for an appointment. Also, the doctor insinuates that my brother wasn’t his patient. This isn’t true. If a doctor is in a possession of one’s medical file (he had my brother’s file on hand), is expected to examine that person and then gets paid for it, that person becomes a patient by default or at least should be extended the same courtesy as any other patient receiving medical care.\nIt is without doubt such practice is utterly unethical because it effectively discriminates against “medicolegal” patients and results in them feeling disregarded and receiving inadequate medical attention. This doctor effectively converted my brother’s medically urgent, physically painful and emotionally humiliating experience into a normalized, passive-income scheme under the pretense of medical care shielded by convoluted legalese. Such practice empowers ethically-impoverished doctors to promote stereotyping and monetization of “medicolegal” patients by misleading them to believe they are about to receive equal treatment as other patients even for a 10- minute “medicolegal” exam. It is no different than a switch and bait scheme. It is in fact a predatory practice where a doctor takes advantage of a sick patient. It is nothing short of a legalized scam that enables Dr. Bender to arbitrarily choose whom to examine based on a single criterion of a 20-minute timeframe which automatically decides if one’s medical condition doesn’t warrant the same level of care as regular patients. That it’s ok to turn a blind eye, literally (my brother was pleading to be seen directly to Dr. Bender in person, in his office), on someone’s painful plight and withhold medical attention only because he has already been paid. This is one corrupt way to misuse a medical degree, if you ask me. Tell me if this isn’t crooked.
