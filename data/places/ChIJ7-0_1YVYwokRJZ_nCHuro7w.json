I was offered a private meeting with the Board and their outside legal counsel. I thought it was odd that the Board would have counsel since they cannot be sued for performing their normal duties and this law firm specialized in law suits against Board members. I said I would have the meeting, even with their attorneys present, but only if the meeting could be opened to all owners and they refused.\nAt that point, I started suffering reprisals. I stopped receiving notices of pharmacy deliveries, maintenance workers either wouldn’t come up or came up and robbed us and nothing was done about it. I was locked out of building link and not allowed to communicate with other owners. While I am not one to automatically think of malfeasance, I do think that people’s actions speak volumes. An honest question deserves an honest response.\nThere are no term limits to Board seats and I think this is a mistake. I think there should be some mechanism for forensic audits (especially after large renovation projects) and that no owner should pay for the Board’s outside counsel.
