There were troubles right from the start. Contacting Konica via phone is an extreme hassle, you are taken from automated menu to automated menu to automated menu then placed on hold for no less than 20 min. I do not enjoy communicating with Konica and regret my purchase of their printer.\n\nPrinter issues: I was immediately assaulted with a F505 error right out of the box, installing the software created major problems that a tech support rep had to remote into my computer to fix. After a restart all seemed to be going well until the printer had to print color. Now I'm seeing magenta streaks all over my documents and it is exceedingly frustrating and putting a choke hold on my business.\n\nWill not purchase again.\n\nUPDATE 2.19.2013\nThe magenta issue became unbearable. Konica sent replacement parts, after I jumped through hoops trying to fix it per their instructions over the phone, I printed 2 glorious prints only to start seeing the streaks immediately after. A tech came to review my printer. His qualifications left much to be desired as he was more interested in selling a new product with additional services (and charges) to me. He had no idea how to correct the issue so sent out for a replacement.\n\nThe replacement gets here quickly and I'm left to set it up by myself - not really appreciated. Right out of the box there are installation issues and the printer won't communicate with my computer to print documents; I'm encountering the same issue I had with the first one right out of the box where it will print one page after I turn it off and turn it back on.\n\nI called FOUR PEOPLE from Konica, the first woman was rather curt and didn't allow me to finish my sentences to receive the complete scope of the problems. She insisted someone should have been sent to install the printer and I told her it was I who had to install it but now it won't communicate with my computer so I need tech support. After repeating the problem 3 times she gives me a 1-800 number to call, doesn't transfer. I called the number, went through the hundred automated menus only to be told that I needed to call yet ANOTHER number to receive help for my specific model. Once again, I had to go through 8 automated menus (after being hung up on 3 times because I pressed the \"0\" to get someone).\n\nOnce I was pushed through to a tech support technician he was able to help me get everything working.\n\nIF the printer continues to print properly and there are no more issues that'll be great. Otherwise I will be setting up a complete return and demanding my money back.\n\nUPDATE: 4.23.2013\n\nPrinter has increasing occurrences of paper jams. Removing the paper isn't enough and Konica support via email states to keep turning it on and off. They also stated they couldn't justify an outbound call until support slows down. 8 automated menus options later I'm on hold still (20 min. in).\n\nWorst customer service. Horrible product. At this rate it would have saved me time and money to keep printing everything on an Epson Inkjet printer and replace it prematurely.\n\nStrongly advise against purchasing anything from Konica.\n\nUPDATE 4.24.2013\n\nSpoke with a manager and he has schedule a replacement machine. Once I receive the machine I am to call Ron again, he provided a direct number (thankfully), and he will schedule a rep. installation.\n\nLet's hope this works!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Recently purchased a Konica Minolta 4690MF for my business.
