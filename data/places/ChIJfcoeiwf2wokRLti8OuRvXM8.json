Because he makes a funeral more like a CELEBRATION of a person's life instead of a grim experience.\nWe told funny and warm and poignant stories about my mom, Grace Karlsen and about Alice's brother, Edward Velsor.\nBoth funerals were memorable and beautiful instead of tragic and traumatic. So many people participated in the funeral, and there were inspiring prayers and hymns too. He handled my husband's MILITARY FUNERAL with grace, sensitivity and true professionalism in November 2014. Every one of the attendees was elderly and on a cane! He dropped us off in front of the restrooms first, and my guests were escorted from the limousines to the bathrooms.  The service was incredibly beautiful and moving. The programs were beautiful too. He made sure that the service people treated me with kindness and respect and gave me his flag. My older brother wanted Raymond Frost to handle his MILITARY funeral but his daughter chose someone else. It was a disaster. A veteran showed up at the cemetery and just handed his ex-wife the flag. My twin brother was so upset that our brother did not get the Military funeral we had planned so my twin brother cried! My twin wants Raymond Frost too.  We will all be interred at Green-Wood Cemetery."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I had Raymond L. Frost handle my mother's cremation.
