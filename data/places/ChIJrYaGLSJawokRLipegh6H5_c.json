I reached to his office a few weeks ago. He met with me via Zoom. He promised to write a letter to a judge on behalf after the “General Counsel” gave him “permission to do so.  Things went left as soon as I expressed “my opinion” that NYC has abandoned the best interest of poor New Yorkers John Francis randomly blocked me.  He ended all communication with me as if I’m not allowed to express my opinion & frustrations as a poor New Yorker.  John Francis is a perfect example of this : if it doesn’t not politically advance the interest of this office then doing the work they take an oath / are hired to do means absolutely nothing to them.  This office is has slumlords best interest at heart & not the interest of the people that need them the most; poor New Yorkers\n\nI am a 42 that has spent the last 7 years overcoming mental health issue, finally earned my right to go back to school to complete my degree & now I’m facing eviction for standing up for my right to live in mold free conditions. I’m facing being homeless because this office as well as NYC Court System has failed to uphold the law.  This office as well as NYC Housing Court allowed Jospeh Bruman to process a eviction against me as retaliation for making “good faith complaints” to NYC 311, DOB + HPD & obtaining a personal injury lawyer that filed a personal injury lawsuit against Bruman Reality for leaving me living w/ mold since May 2020.  As a result I ended up with asthma as well as an iron deficiency. The law is simple ::\n\nN.Y. Real. Prop. Law§ 223-b. Retaliation by landlord against tenant. 1. No landlord of\npremises or units to which this section is applicable shall serve a\nnotice to quit upon any tenant or commence any action to recover real\nproperty or summary proceeding to recover possession of real property in\nretaliation for:\n\na. A good faith complaint, by or in behalf of the tenant, to the\nlandlord, the landlord's agent or a governmental authority of the\nlandlord's alleged violation of any health or safety law, regulation,\ncode, or ordinance, the warranty of habitability\n\n3. A landlord shall be subject to a civil action for damages, attorney's fees and costs and other appropriate relief, including\ninjunctive and other equitable remedies, as may be determined by a court\nof competent jurisdiction in any case in which the landlord has violated the provisions of this section.\n\n4. In any action to recover real property or summary proceeding to\nrecover possession of real property, judgment shall be entered for the tenant if the court finds that the landlord is acting in retaliation for any action set forth in paragraphs a, b, and c of subdivision one of this section. Retaliation shall be asserted as an affirmative defense in such action or proceeding. The tenant shall not be relieved of the obligation to pay any rent for which he is otherwise liable.\n\nNYC Tenants have no true rights & John Francis as well as this office is proof that the power is in the hands of slumlords.  What good are laws if NYC Housing Court has not accountability to oversee their process? This office is a waste of tax payers money. What NYC truly needs is an Office of Accountability to investigate NYC Housing Courts & all govt agencies such as this office to ensure they are doing the very jobs they’re hired & elected to do.   The day that 1875 Atlantic caves in/collapses from cracks as well as mold in the buildings foundation will be the day that this office realizes they dropped the ball with ensuring the residents that live in 1875 are protected. It may not be today but one day this review will help the attorneys that will sue NYC the same way attorneys sued the city of Miami when that building collapsed."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Warning : Public Advocate John Francis doesn’t not have the best interest of poor New Yorkers.
