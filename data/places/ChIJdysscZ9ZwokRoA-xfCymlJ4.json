It seemed simple at first. I used the Parkwhiz website to purchase my spot before my concert and paid before arriving. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a younger employee. He took down my number I was given on the website after payment and said I was good to go after handing him my keys.  He said i just need to show my code again to retrieve my car. By the way, this garage closes at 10 unfortunately, so I had to leave my concert early to retrieve my car. When I returned to the garage, I was greeted with a different, older employee. He had just finished returning a car to a different customer before I got his attention. I promptly showed the QR code I was given on the website and immediately denies me claiming I must need a written card with the parking number on it. I was never given a card earlier by the younger employee. What ensued was about 20 minutes of so of back and forth and arguing that I should’ve gotten a card. I asked for alternatives and if there was anyone can call- and he continued with this dismissive attitude saying that if no one else with a card comes for the car, I can get it tomorrow. I don’t live in NYC and that presents a huge issue. In addition, when I kept pushing about the QR code on the LITERAL WEBSITE, he claims they don’t have a computer. How do you run an online payment system without a computer? It was like talking to a brick wall and I just held my ground and kept my voice firm. I never raised it past reaffirming what had happened regarding the previous employee and yet, he had the gall to threaten to call the police on me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I had just about given up and called her dad to come pick us up. At the same moment, the employee gives up and gives me back my car. After I give a half hearted apology, I leave. I’ve never been so inconvenienced at a parking garage. Please retrain your staff as they definitely are not all on the same page."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I parked here for a concert at the Irving plaza.
