When we walked in we were transported by the authentic ambiance on the restaurant. There is stool bar seating in the front and private dining seating in the back. We made reservations so were accommodated in the private seating area. I throughly enjoyed the private dining experience. You are provided with a call button to alert the waiter when you are ready to order, need assistance, and are ready for your bill. It is a courteous touch that adds to the private dining experience. We ordered the Kyushu Tonkotsu Shio Ramen with Black Garlic, Spicy Kyushu Tonkotsu Ramen, Omurice with demiglaze, Omurice with Pork Tonkatsu and curry sauce. To drink we had the Thai Iced Tea, and a Kyoto White Yuzu. For dessert we ordered the ube cake. Everything was served promptly. Both ramen dishes were of a generous portion with chewy wavy noodles and creamy broth just like I like my ramen. The black garlic really added depth to the dish. Highly recommend it. The omurice dishes were good. Both sauces were delicious but the preferred sauce was the demiglaze. The Thai iced tea was creamy and refreshing. The Kyoto White Yuzu beer was very light with a hint of sweetness. It was a nice pallet cleanser from the rich broth and curry.  The star of the night was hands down the ube cake.  There were more than ten layers of thin pastry with a slight sweet and rich ube cream layered in between. It was a very light and decadent sweet ending to a overall good meal. We were not rushed and sat until we were ready to call for our bill. It was a very pleasant and authentic experience.
