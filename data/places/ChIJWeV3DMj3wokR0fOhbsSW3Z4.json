Sandy infuses each class with incredible energy, her beautiful voice and a ton of fun, creating a structured environment that also allows the children almost complete freedom of expression (no running with drumsticks, please!). The songs — spanning upbeat melodies of celebration to peaceful lullabies — are from all over the world, are in major and minor keys and are expressed in many different styles and meters.

Our daughter sings herself to sleep every night with music we’ve learned from the class (now our 5th rotation!).  She especially loves the short video music lessons that Sandy posts online for members to help us bridge the time between classes as well.
