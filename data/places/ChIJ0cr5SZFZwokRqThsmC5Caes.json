All of us worked early the next morning, so it was frustrating taking so much extra time to get seated and be able to order. The food also took a very long time to arrive that night. Food wise, the 100 layer lasagna, the duck, the short rib, the mushroom pasta dish, the beef carpaccio, and the chocolate tart were some of my favourites. The Osso bucco was fine, but nothing spectacular.
