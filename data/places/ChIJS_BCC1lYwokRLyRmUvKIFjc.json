The car itself was fine after that but upon returning the car the parking garage (early btw) I locked the car with my key and thought I was finished. Flashforward to this morning ￼when I was greeted by my Chase Fraud Protection and a charge from Zipcar for over $1,000! The initial cost I paid was $143 for the day, needless to say this was unneeded stress and financial hardship during a PANDEMIC. Chase has issued me a new debit card but I’m left without one for several days. To top this all off while Zipcar was quick on the phone this morning they said it would take 3 to 5 days to review my account even though the phone rep said he’s “escalated it to high priority”. Be very careful with this company, there are many promises but they under deliver. Amongst my friends who also use their service there have been other horror stories. I would say if you need a car in NYC rent one for a day from Enterprise or Sixt. With Zipcar you’ll get a dirty car that’s most likely delivered late with a low gas tank and potentially marijuana in the trunk."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"RENTER BEWARE (ESPECIALLY IN NYC): I recently rented a car from Zipcar on 10/5 from 8:00 AM to 2 PM to visit my doctor.
