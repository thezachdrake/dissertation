As first time expecting parents we were excited yet nervous. We waited over an hour our first visit which is understandable, however, the office staff never communicated any delays while we sat waiting only a few feet from them the entire hour. It wasn't until I got up and asked that they confirmed she was running behind. After meeting Dr. Elliston we felt she was compassionate and knowledgeable and decided to continue care with her. Our second visit and every visit after we again waited over an hour and the office staff failed to communicate any delays with us. I am a healthcare professional that manages a busy outpatient practice and I understand there are delays but a patient's quality of care is dependent upon proper communication. First, we update our patients every 15 minutes of any delays because we understand our patients are anxious and we want them to know we respect their time. Second, I would never allow my staff to sit around chatting and eating lunch in patient care areas. It's unfortunate that a qualified physician like Dr. Elliston has such a poorly managed and unprofessional office staff. It wasn't until my third visit that I noticed she was expecting and congratulated her. She assured me that she would be back in time to deliver our baby but she would have me meet her partner just in case; I never met her partner. We received a letter today from Dr. Elliston stating \"she could no longer serve as our physician due to fact that she has a small practice and there are times she has to go and do emergency deliveries which may cause a delay in her schedule- that a bigger practice may be better suited for us\". I am 6.5 months along and this was the most unprofessional handling I've ever seen. After months under her care and building trust, a phone call would have been appreciated and just the right thing to do. Pregnancy is stressful enough and then to have such a stressful experience with the person you trusted most to care for you and your baby is just horrible patient care. Im lucky I work in the healthcare industry and have the help to find a better physician but I sympathize with anyone else this has happened to that isn't so fortunate.
