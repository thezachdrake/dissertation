She played with my little one and spoke to her and kept both my girls entertained while I was getting looked at. Then the dentist assistant was wonderful. My little one has sensory sensitivity and was very scared to open her mouth and the assistant was amazing and even though she didn’t get her teeth cleaned here she was sad because she wanted to. My older child was scared too but the dentist and assistant made her feel safe. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I am extremely pleased.
