He gave me a second dose, but only waited 1-2 minutes before proceeding. I could still feel the pain, but when I said this he ran me through a series of questions and pokes. I could tell by the line of questioning that he assumed I was nervous and that my pain was psychosomatic. He continued drilling even when I was raising my hand for him to stop. By the time he was near the end of drilling I could tell the novocaine was finally fully kicking in. For fillings in the past I have had to have a second dose of novocaine (while waiting extra time for it to set in), and every dentist always trusts my word that I can still feel the pain and they respond accordingly. Never have I had a dentist that doubted my pain and experience and then kept drilling when I asked them to stop.
