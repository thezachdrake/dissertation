The menu was decent but not a traditional Japanese restaurant but I did enjoy the Black Cod Misozaki (fish marinated in miso and lightly grilled, it was very delicate and the chef prepared a beautiful garnish of avocado and ikura / salmon roe.) it wasn’t enough for dinner so I also ordered two pieces of Ikura and Uni (sea urchin) with a glass of Pinot Grigio - I decided not to order miso soup or rice… that costs extra. The total bill was $76. Including tax. Granted that the seafood flew from California, like me… and I wondered why the heck was I ordering sushi when I could get it back in CA! 🥴 Anyway, dinner was fine, the wasabi wasn’t real it was the squirt kind, no edamame was offered, no hot towels for the hands, no orange sherbet or tangerine for dessert, and the sad thing was that it wasn’t plated aesthetically (w/o garnish, at these prices?) I felt the service could have been more hospitable too. Also they locked the doors so I had to be let out because there were three rough looking guys tripping out right next to the door entrance.
