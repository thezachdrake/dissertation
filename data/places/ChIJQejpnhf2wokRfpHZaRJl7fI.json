I watched him for awhile at home, took some videos of him just in case i needed to show what was wrong & had a really bad feeling. My dog is also 60lbs & i live on the 5th floor of a 5 floor walk-up. basically i wanted to walk him over to the vet before i felt like god-forbid he'd collapse cause there's no way i'm carrying him. Long story short we get there & I just ask to sit in the waiting room for awhile because I feel safer there in the event that anything should happen. Without hesitation, Dr. Obernesser comes over, asks what's wrong, and immediately checks on my dog. Feels him up, looks in his mouth & reassures me that I can go home and in the event that his condition stays the same come back before they close...i left feeling better that at least i didn't kill my dog....instead of going back later that afternoon called up & made an appointment for a thorough exam just to really know what was going on. Tues we went to see Dr. Obernesser, Kircher got a full once over and was prescribed anti-inflammatory & one other Rx. i honestly thought it was going to cost me a fortune. like i'll be living on PBJ break what's left of bank kind of expensive BUT NO. Paid for the visit and Rx but more importantly the feeling of knowing that this is place where they CARE FIRST and take the treatment in phases and reasonable steps. This is truly a neighborhood vet where the staff cares about not only your pet but you too.
