They pack 17 people in that van where they have to be for 1 hour and 30 minutes every morning at 7 a.m. and every evening at 5 p.m. My mother has been sent to jobs from this agency before and she’s always had to pay $60 for the van. The worst part is that instead of hiring more drivers and renting or buying more vans, the agency decides to put a bunch of people in a vehicle. Their safety is at risk because most of them cannot even have a seatbelt available to use. But a lot of individuals are in a situation where they don’t have an option but to accept those terms due to their despair.
