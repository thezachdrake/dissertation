Nothing fancy, but you’ll never look bad\nYou don’t go here for the conversation, or to have a good relaxing time. There is none of that at Fademan, you go there for a reliable quick haircut. That’s it.\nSeriously, his towels smell like they’ve not been washed in weeks. I have to shower as soon as I get home to get rid of the smell.\nBut that’s not the point. Now to the reason why today was my last haircut at Fademan and why I recommend people stay away from this overpriced, average quality barbershop with an owner/ barber that is generally rude to customers.\nLet’s preface the story by quoting the 1st text I got from this man: “To all new clients:tips are cash only.”\nOk. No problem. Every single time after getting a cut I would go to the DR down the street and cash out $10 to give a tip after the cut was done. All good. Never had any complaints from the guy. I thought to my self I’m paying $76 (haircut + beard trim) + $10 tip, so close to $90 every time I go to this place. Expensive, but convenient, so whatever.\nToday I bought gum after getting the $10 and instead of leaving my regular $10 I left $8 and get the text that comes next:\n“Listen bro.you drop me 8bucks for haircut and beard ,you usually drop 10 . Honestly still short .8bucks for 70bucks service, you're so generous!My average tips are 10bucks for haircut,you are short tips all the time I never say anything right! Today 8 bucks ,thank you so much .You give the chance to block you permanently.have a great day.”\nThe guy literally blocked me for a tip that was $2 short of usual. It’s absurd. I’m already paying an overpriced haircut for you to go bananas over $2?!?!\nI’ve seen him get pretty aggressive with walk ins. Guy is overall very rude, but today’s text was overboard.\nIn sum, OK expensive haircuts from a rude dude. I do not recommend. Get your haircuts from someone nicer.
