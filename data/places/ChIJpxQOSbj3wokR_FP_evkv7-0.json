I think CASA is simply superior to Columbia student housing, which is why many savvy Columbia students live in CASA.\n\nI've rented for more than a decade in NYC, North Carolina, California (SF and LA), and Delaware. Mark is by far the most responsive and helpful landlord I have ever met. Here are a few examples:\n\n(1) When we moved in, one of our keys didn't work well with the door lock - it took a dozen tries to open it. Mark inspected it, bought a new door lock, and replaced the lock - all by himself - within two days.\n\n(2) Our apartment's electricity went out at 11:25pm. I texted Mark, hoping he'd respond by morning. Within minutes he responded. Then he promptly came to the apartment and fixed it. It was midnight.\n\nGenerally, if you ask Mark for help, he responds within hours if not minutes. Most of the time he's able to fix everything by himself just as quickly. He doesn't delay or make excuses. Evening, weekends, if he's in town (he almost always is) he's got you covered.\n\nMost neighbors I've met are Columbia affiliates, and all are very polite and nice. I've lived in Columbia student housing before - CASA's tenants are much quieter on average. I've never heard noise (e.g. music or screaming) from my neighbors in CASA.\n\nMy apartment has in-unit laundry. The laundry machine is a front-loading LG Inverter Direct Drive. It washes and dries perfectly, is quite new (as of Jan 2022), and plays a happy song when finishing up."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"TL;DR: The most responsible landlord ever, unbeatable location, in-unit laundry.
