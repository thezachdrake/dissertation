Put any questions I had at ease given fact HW has been using his company for years and didn't have to worry about credibility or insurance etc... All was vouched and provided for. They provided me his contact info to move furniture I bought and deliver it to my place. Called him...extremely nice guy was able to do job in very timely manner. Affordable, professional team, incredibly careful with handling of pieces. That was back in April.\n\nI then called him mid August to see if he or employees were available to move a size-able  amount of furniture out of my apartment as I am moving few blocks down. He came with large, and clean moving van. Guys went above and beyond - wrapping furniture for extra protection even after I had done so prior to their arrival. I could not have come across for NYC almost a secret gem that thanks to housing works wouldn't have ever known about. I had called multiple other moving companies before remembering Ken's Moving Service. All 4 couldn't accommodate dates, all had mixed reviews and I was quoted nearly triple what Ken charged. Highly highly recommend. Runs an incredibly seamless, smooth operation.
