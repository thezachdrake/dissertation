It could be the mistake of the person who checked us in but anyway I'm very upset with Kalahari. The bracelet key didn't work as the room key so we had to line up and waited for long time again to get the new one and the person who assisted us to check in told us she put my room and the room of my friend as close as possible and we found out that we are in the different wings. My friend's room will be ready before mine because it is almost ready but they didn't get the text message until after 4pm, so they had to call to find out. I understand that it could take long to get the room ready but I was upset because it was different from what she promised. The biggest issue is that the new bracelet we've got or the staff at the towel exchange booth didn't work at all. We picked up 4 towels and returned all of them on the same day but we are charged with $150 for not returning the towels. The staff at the towel station didn't even count how many I returned before threw them into the bin and I even doubled checked with my room number because I couldn't trust if my bracelet was working correctly. The staff confirmed that I returned everything and now my invoice has $150 for the towels. I got the text saying I'm going to be charged $30 for the towel on the last day of my trip so I talked to the staff at the front desk about the issue and she promised that she will resolve the issue but now I'm charged even more. I spent so much time in the line for the front desk in order to resolve the issues that is made by the resort and my time is wasted since nothing has resolved. I am very upset with all the electronic system and check-in process. Now I'm back at home and trying to reach someone at the resort but no one picks up the phone.
