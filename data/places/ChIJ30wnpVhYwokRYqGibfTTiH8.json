I decided to change my regular WeWork spaces and try something new. Bought the daily pass to check the place with a hope to spend a day working there and ultimately move to upgrading to their offices. Unfortunately my experience was a pure disaster. I walked in at 9:50am, left at 10:47am. The receptionist was rude and sarcastic, definitely felt unwelcomed from the moment I walked in. When I asked where can I sit she said \"I placed you there\", pointing to a few miserable chairs. I then asked her about other types of memberships such as dedicated desks and she had no clue about cost and what each entails (lockers, etc). Didn't even move from her chair, sitting all the time, definitely didn't even bother to show me around. She then told me that they have two other floors above and when I said I'll go to check those out, she said NO, I placed you here, again pointing to the miserable chairs. So I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and set on the \"assigned\" chair. Right next to me there was a woman who obviously came there to waste time chatting and laughing loud with her friends on zoom call telling them how she came in a cowering space to \"get away from home\" because they were installing oven and she didn't wanted to deal with that and left her husband deal with that, laughing like a lunatic. And here's me trying to do some work! I gave her a look few times with a hope that she'll figure out that this is not Starbucks and instead she continued to laugh even lauder. At the same time you have the receptionist giving an extremely welcome tour to a guy who she obviously found attractive and was hoping to get a date and literally showed him the entire place explaining in details what type of membership he can have. They ended up going on the other floors ... I guess he was \"allowed and assigned\", even tho he was only a walk-in (didn't even purchase a pass unlike me).
