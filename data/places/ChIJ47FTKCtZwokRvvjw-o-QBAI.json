I am absolutely disgusted with Dr. Boltunova's handling of my case.  She promised help she in no way delivered.  She misinformed me.\nThe specifics are this:  I was contacted by Weil Cornell's Pain Mgmt department and was offered a lifeline: a way OFF opiate pain medication, in my case, Oxycodone.\n\nThe first visit was very good.  Dr. Boltunova saw how committed I was to detoxing off the meds, interchanging them with Trigger Point Pain injections, physical therapy AND help from what she deemed a key focus for safe detox: a Neuropsychologist.\nI had ~ back in 2009 ~ a great experience in medication adjustment of another kind from a Neuropsychiatrist and was excited to approach this.\n\nTo cut this short, it was IMPOSSIBLE to locate a Neuropsychologist OR Neuropsychiatrist in the NYC area who dealt with anything other than Neuro psych evaluations.  I am a dedicated researcher and self advocate in the areas of Health and Medical needs for many years now.  After MONTHS of chasing after the mythical Neuropsych who TREATS people a/or helps them with medication management, I had to go another route ~ Suboxone.  Which was a nightmare and caused me harm I'm now trying to recover from.\n\nDr. Boltunva's continued belief in this route was further proved completely incorrect when I did something she and her team deemed impossible: using the Weil Cornell Neuropsych Department who they claimed on several occasions, were impossible to reach, much less obtain an appointment with - as they were booked solid and notorious for being a nonstarter.  Guess what?  After pulling my FACE off looking across multiple listings over the Internet, my Insurance company, my Case Manager with both Northwell Health, and the NYU hospital system ~ I tried Weil Cornell and got through IMMEDIATELY, receiving a call back within one hour of calling to inquire who might help me.  Again, it turns out their Neuropsychologists do not deal in medication management or detoxing patients from Opiates!!!!!\n\nDr. Boltunova didn't even know the facts involved in the incredibly urgent matter of getting patients off Opiate pain meds.  Her specialty?  Pain Management with the extreme stress on them NOT dealing in Opiates.\n\nTHERE IS MORE.  Her office took over two weeks \"getting authorization\" from my Insurance company each time I was to get another round of Trigger Point Pain injections.  OVER 2 weeks for them to do this simple thing and then get back to me with an appointment over two MORE weeks out!!!\nNow that I have reverted to a Pain Management CLINIC right in my own neighborhood, I get approval through them for the SAME injection therapy within the normal one week's time and a quick follow-up appointment.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this woman or Weil Cornell's Pain Management Department  to anyone.  Ever.\n\nAdding to all this was what happened during what I made my last appointment with the doctor (I believe my 3rd after my initial assessment).  Instead of the attention and time taken with the first Trigger point injections  which she did herself, and then the time taken for the 2nd series done by one of her team with her in attendance ~ she rushed through my last series in less than 7 minutes with someone in training, no less, watching her hurry through my procedure.  I will mention that the 1st series of injections were comprised of many injections across my back, neck and shoulders and was helpful over some time.  Each successive time the number of injections, how they FELT & how they acted, lessened.  On the last visit she left the room without asking if I had questions or concerns.  When I had dressed and asked for her, no one knew where she or her intern was.\nI left in disgust and still am amazed at the difference in care I am receiving from a much less expensive, equally qualified physician of less prestige."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I HOPE YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM READING MY EXPERIENCE.\n\nI am changing my review from earlier in 2023.
