Next, one of the 2 baristas' friends dropped by, and started hanging out right by the espresso machine counter -- she might also be a Sbucks employee but wasn't working, so the 2 of them were laughing, and talking very loudly, which also seemed to distract the barista from doing her job efficiently.\n\nThen, I had the customer thing happen where it seemed that everyone around me got their order and left, even people who were in line behind me. When I asked the barista if she had a caramel apple spice coming up, she looked at me slightly annoyed and said \"I'm working on it now.\" When I got it, it was 5:55 and I had to leave the store immediately to run to work. As I was walking the block to my work, I noticed there was no whipped cream, or caramel sauce in the drink - it was just hot apple cider. It was still good, but not worth $7 IMHO.
