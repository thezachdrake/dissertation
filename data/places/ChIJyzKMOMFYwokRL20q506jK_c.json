I really believed if I had another ob my baby would’ve been a c-section. As a first time mom Dr. Jin addressed all my concerns throughout my pregnancy, she was also very proactive at all times and always a step ahead for all treatments I needed along the way. She diagnosed me with gestational diabetes at 10 weeks! She didn’t wait for me to hit 26 weeks in order for me to start controlling my glucose level. I believe that proactive decision was what helped me take control early enough to have a healthy birth. As per the birth experience with dr. Jin I would do it all over again. Throughout my pregnancy I heard a lot of horror birth stories of how doctors just do c sections because they want to get rid of you and cash a check. How doctors don’t listen and respect your decisions throughout labor. I had a natural birth because my doctor was Dr. Jin I’m a firm believer of that. She gave me the best pep talk to encourage me that my body was made for this and that I can do it. I pushed for 40 mins and my baby was out. I live out of state and I traveled to have my baby with Dr. Jin because I didn’t trust no other doctor and she did not disappoint at all! She promised me on my first prenatal visit that she would be delivering my baby and she kept that promise I have never heard of or seen that before. If your a first time mom having Dr. Jin as your ob will make you think birth is an easy and pleasant experience. I have the best birth story because she was my doctor. I will forever be grateful for her."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr. Jin hands down is the best obgyn I have ever had and in my opinion the best at Weill Cornell.
