In my experience, because I chose the right coach for me, every dollar and minute I've spent on coaching have been money and time well invested in my career, personal life, health, lifestyle, mindset, and happiness.\n\nHighly recommend Jerry to anyone looking for the myriad of benefits that coaching can bring.
