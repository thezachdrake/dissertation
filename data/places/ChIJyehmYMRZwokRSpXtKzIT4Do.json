We went with premium menu and added extra:  A5 wagyu, truffle and uni plus Toro hand roll.\n\nTuna appetizer, oyster shooter w uni, hamachi were wonderful starters. Loved uni and ikura mini donburi. Smoked flavor was infused. Out of all 10 pc sushi, I loved Toro with truffled caviar, scallop and ebi.\nHokkaido Uni was so sweet and amazing.\n\nOur server Abbie was so professional and friendly and made our dining experience exceptional.\nMochi dessert was simple and delicious.
