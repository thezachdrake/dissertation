What a delight. My chum and I came in here to cleanse our palates after a pretty rough margarita experience a few doors down on the same block. We walked 20 feet, I saw this place, said, \"I wish we'd gone in here instead,\" and my chum said, \"We can.\" I realized she was right, and that was that. This is definitely my vibe. Sign me up for exposed brick, obligatory monochrome pictures and lots of wood. I just wish we'd had an appetite to sample more of the menu.\n\nWe came in here right before a mini rainstorm around 2ish this past Saturday afternoon. Now that I'm thinking about it, literally every place we stopped in at on our trek up Broadway was empty, regardless of the time of day. Was everyone out of town? No idea. Anyway. I don't recall any other customers inside while we were there.\n\nDespite an atrocious Old Fashioned the prior weekend that made me dramatically declare I was done with bourbon, all of the hipster leather wore me down and I went with the Craftsman Campfire, conveniently served in a campfire mug. My chum side-eyed it a bit, concerned it was going to be served hot, but it was thankfully a cold beverage that provided a refreshing boost on a muggy summer day. My initial reaction was a little negative - the first few sips tasted like bland iced tea, and I'm not sure why. Maybe it wasn't blended entirely? I didn't really taste the referenced fall flavors (cinnamon, apple, etc.), but once I dropped the lemon garnish in and mixed it around, everything was solid.\n\nThe service and price point were fine - we actually experienced the opposite of sticker shock when we discovered the cocktails here were around $15 (par for the course, even this far north in Manhattan) versus the $20 next door at the mediocre Mexican place. THIS is the establishment that probably could get away with charging more for the artisanal cocktail goodness. I thought it took a LITTLE long to get the drinks, given that no one else was on the premises, but we weren't in a rush. It also wasn't the kind of situation where we needed waitstaff to check in on us on a regular basis - very DIY here.\n\nI don't know how long it's going to take me to convince someone to hike up Manhattan again, but we're absolutely putting The Craftsman on the itinerary."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"If you've ever seriously questioned how gentrified the island of Manhattan is, the fact that an edgy hipster cocktail bar like this is located above 125th Street should answer that for you.
