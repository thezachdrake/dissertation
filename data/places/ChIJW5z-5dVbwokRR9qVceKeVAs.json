I am a very sentimental person and I treasure memories captured in photos and videos. I knew that finding a great photographer for my wedding would require extensive research and it was very important to find just the right one for my event. I dont remember exactly how I came upon Sasha Chou (probably google) but I do remember her sitting pretty comfortably on the top of my potential vendors-list for awhile before I made my final decision to commit.\n\nWhat stuck out to me about Sasha was her wedding packages and most importantly, her photography style. I was debating if I really needed videography and if I really needed 2 photographers and videographers at that. And if I needed an engagement photoshoot (the answer is yes, ofc 😂😂😂) In the end, it seemed like a worthwhile investment to have a dual team for both, and Sasha happened to offer a reasonably priced package for just that. She also offered a 1 hr engagement shoot to better fit my needs. In addition, she and her team offered 9 hours of work, which also fit my needs. She was also probably about $3000 less expensive than another company I was considering, so that was a plus as well. I also do value supporting female-owned businesses as well as Asian businesses.\n\nBesides affordability, I also really liked Sasha’s photography style for weddings. Im not really into dark and moody, nor am I really into the super serious editorial look either. I like a mixture of traditional photography (poses and setup of photos) paired with a bit of fine-arts photography (airy feels, natural lighting and nice backdrops). I also enjoy when a photographer doesnt do much more to photos other than enhancing the contrast in the image just a bit. Fun fact: the only filters I ever like and use are ones that simply enhance contrast and/or brightness of an image.\n\nWorking with Sasha was pretty straightforward, and I mean this in terms of communication through email, over the phone, and in person. I do remember that after our initial engagement session, my husband did remark that he liked that she could make us laugh. When I got the engagement photos, I was quite happy with how they turned out. The photos had nice color and they just felt airy and light.\n\nSasha and her team arrived to the venue early on the day of my wedding. And they worked efficiently with capturing my dress and details and all of our couple-photos, family photos, and wedding party photos. I expected the whole process to take more than 2.5 hours, but we were done quicker than that. I also liked that she and her team were gentle and respectful with handling our parents, who are much less familiar with the whole photo-process.\n\nThe rest of my wedding day was a bit of a blur, but I know they were working hard for us for the whole evening. They stayed a little bit past the agreed upon time of 9:30 PM to capture some last minute details, and I appreciate that. Im so excited to see my photos. Im sure they’ll be good.\n\nI would definitely recommend Sasha and her team for any wedding.\n\nPS I can proudly say that I was the one who taught Sasha how to share her screen on Google Meets 😂😂😂"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Even during my early wedding planning days, I knew that the two most important things to invest in for my wedding were 1) great food and 2) a great photography team.
