Bhagavat is my favorite thing about New York City...and that's saying a lot!  In a city where connections to people, to food, and to the environment are not always optimal, Bhagavat Life offers a warm safe haven.  They offer cooking classes, private dinners, catering, etc.  My favorite are the cooking classes.  My most memorable experience was making almond milk from my own two hands by squeezing the almond milk from a cheese cloth. Divya and her team gently encourage you to go back and re-connect with your food.  Eating is one of the most intimate acts we can do to ourselves.  What we eat...we become.  So Bhagavat helps you learn about the most optimal combinations of foods that are right for you.....and the food is the most delicious I have ever eaten.  I do not think that any food better than this exists on our planet earth....I truly feel that every single time I taste the delicious meals that we cook together as a team.  The people that come have beautiful souls! I am grateful, blessed, and lucky to have found this place and I hope more can discover it and start their own journeys."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Where to start.

The many preps were labled individually, noting my dietary restrictions and resulting adjustments—all correct. I also received an email prior to delivery with the menu, detailed descriptions, medicinal values, and every ingredient, including highlighted ingredients that were omitted by request. I had heard that every ingredient was chosen and prepared consciously—for example the ghee is made and cultured using raw milk to maximize freshness, digestibility and flavor—but wasn’t prepared for how beautiful each item and packaging was. It was delivered in stainless steel tiffins (stacked containers) and glass jars—no plastic and no paper. Each item was garnished beautifully and the array of colors was stunning. All this would have been impressive enough, but the meal was both sumptuous and invigorating. I have never been a fan of beets, but Divya’s red lentil and beet pate was out of the world, containing cilantro, lime juice and an array of medicinal spices in perfect harmony. Preparations included zucchini with almonds (paneer cheese omitted to accommodate my request), pecans and orange wild rice pilaf, kale and collards with sweet potatoes, spinach and taro soup, chai (gently sweetened with maple syrup), asparagus and parsnips (made with a delectable blend of nourishing spices). My only regret is missing out on the cilantro cashew chutney and on the chocolate mousse, omitted because of Bhagavat Life’s cautious adherence to client requests like mine, to leave out anything with sugar. I can’t say enough about the quality of this experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I received my first meal from Bhagavat Life today, delivered to me in Midtown five minutes early—still warm.
