It’s a small but authentic Thai restaurant that you usually find in Thailand so make sure to come early as they get filled up quick. We usually do not like fried fresh fish but they managed to keep the freshness flavor even after deep frying it. The sauce is made in-house which guarantees that you won’t be able to find that flavor anywhere else. Beef soup is constantly warmed in a pot which is perfect for this chilly weather with the broth tasting better than any pho noodle broth. Most importantly, it’s not too salty and it actually quenches your thirst after having that soup. Don’t miss out their happy hour from 5-9pm for their house-made sangria for $5 a glass or $20 a pitcher. Even though the server was super busy taking care of everyone including phone calls, takeouts, and walk-in customers, she managed it with a friendly smile while making sure everyone is served properly and efficiently.
