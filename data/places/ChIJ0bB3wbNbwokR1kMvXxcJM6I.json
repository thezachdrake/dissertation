I ordered the Second Spring cocktail (vodka/passionfruit/lime) which was tart and delicious. The burger was excellent, juicy and flavorful with caramelized onions (yum!) and Gouda (so good!). The fries are mostly crispy but there were some softer ones in there as well. The crab cakes were also excellent, with a corn pick that had the perfect amount of jalapeños. The crab cake itself was delicious and had a great crust, and the chipotle sauce on them was the perfect compliment.
