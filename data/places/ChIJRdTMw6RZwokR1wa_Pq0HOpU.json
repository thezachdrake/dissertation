Lior Malka's website caught my eye, so I decided to give them a go.  I am SO happy that I did.\n\nThe salon is clean, professional, and has a nice view of the Empire State Building. What puts this salon over the top (other than Ian's undeniable talent, discussed below) is the staff. They are extremely respectful not only to the clients, but also to each other. There is no hierarchy or \"I'm better than you\" attitude. In this industry, I think this level of respect is rare, and even harder to find in New York City.\n\nIan is an absolute Godsend.  He is a magician with color and extensions, and I can honestly say my hair has never looked better.  I came to him with zebra-striped highlights, ratchet extensions, and damaged hair.  Ian has truly transformed my hair and subsequently, my confidence.  He listens to what his clients want, and makes it come to life.  I've been seeing him since September and even my natural hair is healthier and growing. Moving from Denver, I was a bit hesitant because of the much higher NYC prices, but he is honestly worth every penny. He's also an insanely beautiful human, so there's that, too.\n\nIn terms of the other individuals, Ben is a master at creating the perfect \"Victoria's Secret model\" loose curl. The receptionist, Biri, always works with my difficult work schedule to get me an appointment that works for me. She also has gone out of her way to make me comfortable, one time even making a fresh pot of coffee at 6pm without the slightest complaint. And although I have never had my hair colored by Lior, his work always looks flawless from across the salon.\n\nIf you're looking for a salon in the City, or even if you're content at your current salon, I recommend you try Lior Malka. It really is an amazing place."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"In short, I HIGHLY recommend Lior Malka.\n\nI moved to NYC a few months ago from Colorado, and a stylist in Denver gave me a list of salons near my new apartment that used the same brand of extensions I had been using.
