I bought a groupon and made an appointment. They didn 't answer but sent a text that I can make an appointment through text only-so I did. Immediately I received a text letting me know all the conditions they have about being penalized should you need to cancel or reschedule. I made sure to be on time. I was asked to wait so I did. The salon was not busy and at the time I had no idea that Kurtis was the man sitting and playing with his phone for the 15 minutes I was kept waiting. He looked unhappy or was having a bad day. I waited patiently and said he has probably had a rough day. When he approached me he seemed unfriendly and abrupt. He asked me what i wanted and I just went for a trim given his mood and demeanor. He asked how much of a trim and I answered 2\". Long story short, he never smiled or spoke again but he did his job and I gratefully just sat there. When it came time to blow dry my hair he just asked wave or straight and i responded straight. He pulled my hair several times during the blow dry by I didn't make any remark just kind of pulled away. Finally he got to the crown of my head and he pulled the brush really hard and literally I screamed out. He didn't even say sorry or anything. He just continued and once again he pulled my hair on the other side and I said you are hurting me . Again no apology or anything. I just took off the apron and said \"that is enough\".\nI Got my bag and walked out. This is the first time in my life that i walked out without any tip. The guy seemed insane. I will never go back. We can all have bad days but you can keep your professional demeanor and say sorry if you hurt a client. I could have dealt with the negative vibe but i don't need to be treated badly and no respect. If you don't like your job or you are tired it is understandable but don't be a jerk to others about it. I had a $30 tip ready until he got to the crown of my head and didn't even apologize. I can understand not everyday is a sunny day, but seriously, save your money.
