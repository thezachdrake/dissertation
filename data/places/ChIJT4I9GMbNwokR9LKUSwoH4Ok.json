The entire experience last about 8 minutes. The whole experience takes place between a bunch of black curtains, they did not even have the budget to create or use actual rooms. You first walk into a room (black curtains) and a doll greets you and welcomes you to the show, then you walk into a hall to see a display of dolls like chukee & Annabelle set up in cheap plastic boxes. Then you will sit at a tea party and the actress will offer you a roach. Then you will have to crawl in a tunnel full of doll heads (very underwhelming) and then you enter another room where you are told to look at a screen to see which \"doll you are\" and then asked to leave and walk through a short hall of flashing lights and doll heads and an actress dressed in doll heads. It terms of fear factor I'd give this a 1, it would hardly scare a young child. In terms of set design I'd give it a 0 because there was no effort put into the rooms, again it was literally just black curtains with no props. In terms of the actors I'd give them a 3, they were carrying the entire experience as there was nothing else the haunted house had to offer, but again the acting wasn't scary and very underwhelming. It cost $40 for this haunted house. The experience is worth about $10-15, maybe even less, it seems like it would've been better as part of a fair or bigger exhibit and not a stand alone haunted house. If someone asked me if they should go, I'd say no, save your money."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I will tell you EXACTLY what to expect.
