It had been my third time at the restaurant and yet AGAIN, it is still my favorite.\n\nI was introduced to the restaurant by Scott Burnhard and it has become one of my most priced vegan eateries ever since.\n\nOn this special Sunday, my roommate Azali and I were fortunate enough to meet the owners. An older couple, Mercedes & Angel, DEDICATED to health and clean eating!\n\nWhen asking questions about the creation of the menu, Angel is the orchestrator behind it all! He gives the chefs and cooks the concepts, and they create the genius masterpieces.\n\nAnd by gawd, that menu IS GENIUS! Completely creative and exceptionally innovative.\n\nIf you LOVE plant based food, this is a PLANT BASED HEAVEN!\n\nI quoted Angel on something that he said, that truly touched me. “[We] make food for the sick & the healthy,” he mentioned. “This food makes sick people healthy, and it keeps the healthy people healthy.”\n\nI LOVE that concept. It’s truly commitment to sustenance and healing.\n\nHis wife, Mercedes, was amazing as well, when talking about the best, most optimal way to receive food, she wisely told us, “I used to think we are what we eat, now I understand we are what we absorb.”\n\nPreparation on how to receive the BEST nutrients from food is even more important than the food itself!\n\nBut let’s get into the DETAILS!\n\nThere is LIVE Music Daily at 7:30pm, so please come to dinner and catch a vibe.\n\nOur waiter, Christian, was AMAZING!!\n\nHe first served us the Seitan Nachos, which were savory, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. Easily one of my favorite appetizers.\n\nThe owner, Angel also insisted that we try the Warm Hummus & Pesto Zattar. TO DIE FOR!\n\nWe were offered the Peanut Sesame Noodles which are, Gluten Free, Organic Noodles made from Quinoa! I thought that was so cool! There is of course peanut butter, made in-house and topped with sesame seeds. I’d describe this dish as very subtle! So, not my favorite, since I prefer food packed with flavor. It is a light peanut sauce, served warm and has a very very slight sweetness.\n\nThere is a complimentary side Salad that comes with EVERY Entrée. And my roommate ordered the RAW Pizzetta, while I ordered the Huitlacoche and Chorizo Quesadilla.\n\nAzali said the Pizzetta was BOMB! She described the dough as a happy medium between chewy and crunchy. She described the taste of the pizza sauce as creamy with a bit of a tangy flavor.\n\nThe Huitlacoche and Chorizo Quesadilla was INCREDIBLE! It was super spicy, which was a shock to me, and it’s served with a vinaigrette micro green salad, fresh diced mango, and a dipping sauce. The flavors were literally a perfect balance and the dish was BIG and incredibly filling. SO GOOD OMG!\n\nFor drinks, I ordered the Hibiscus Iced Tea, of which I added a lot of agave — it comes unsweetened. And Azali ordered the Organic Piña Colada. She said it was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we chose to share the Warm Brownie Sundae which came with coconut cream based icecream & coconut whipped cream atop baked, rich dark chocolate brownies and fresh, sliced, strawberries.\n\nAngel also offered us Pancakes. Which are the most tasty Gluten Free, Sugar Free, and Dairy Free treats you will ever taste. They came with blueberries inside. And he requested a scoop of both house made strawberry & chocolate icecream, with two small mounds of coconut whipped cream. Literally so good! And that STAWBERRY ICE CREAM?! I don’t even like strawberry flavors like that… delicious.\n\nThe last of a long night of treats & sweets, was their Creamy Macchiato.  Their Macchiato is a health powerhouse. It’s Gluten Free, Coffee Free, Caffeine Free, and made with an array of ingredients including Chicory Root & Roasted Dandelion Root, which gives it the taste of coffee. It was a subtle sweetness from the Coconut Cream so if you want it more Dulce, request added agave.\n\nI cannot express enough how MAGICAL the night was! Third time is the CHARM!
