Normally these amenities are part of living in a luxury building.  It Is very frustrating dealing with the management of this building because their focus is more on selling units than tending to the current residents. They take months to get back to you on issues on your unit and claim that it’s not their problem. I also don’t recommend closing your apartment till everything on your check list is done as my checklist has still not been completed after 1 and 1/2 years of living. The construction workers are also a big issue as every part of the building is dusty and dirty. The construction workers are often using all the elevators and are very rude to residents telling us we don’t belong here. I would wait to purchase a unit in this building as no one even knows when construction will end and that could be another 2 years.
