Well, I’ve been looking to have laser treatments done in the past but refused to go to NYC even though I’m like 20 minutes away because of parking and tolls, etc. and then Body MedSpa in Metuchen appeared in my Groupon with an amazing deal. I did a quick google search and saw they had mostly good reviews, so made the purchase. A week later I called to setup my appointment and instantly regretted buying this Package for 6 sessions.\n\nFirst, when you call the MedSpa you don’t even know you’re calling the MedSpa. You realize that you’re calling some guy’s cell phone or a number routed to someone’s cell phone and when he answers he doesn’t even announce the name of his business. He was NOT knowledgeable at all about any of the treatment services, but knew all about the Groupon packages which he tried to get me to upgrade to a greater package. While on the phone with him I became really alarmed and googled again, but then dug deep into the reviews. For every negative review they make sure to invalidate your experience by replying that they don’t know, and then, and this is purely speculation, hire people to create positive reviews. Yes, this can be done because I, myself, have hired a companies to leave positive reviews in exchange for some type of fee or service.\n\nLook, I am completely aware that I just Blew ~$150, but this is my lesson learned that I need to call a business before ever purchasing their Groupon promotion. This place is too sketchy for me.
