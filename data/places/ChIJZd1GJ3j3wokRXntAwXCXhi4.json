Roger is a certified fitness expert, but he outshines the typical trainers with his attentiveness and ability to adapt to the client's needs. I live a few blocks north of Central Park, close to where Roger, for around two decades, has worked out with clients at Adam Clayton Powell Blvd. and Central Park North. Before I started training with Roger, I noticed how frequently he and recurring clients worked out together. I saw Roger lead his clients in a variety of exercises, which often looked like fun challenges rather than typical gym reps. I wanted to lose weight, but I initially was nervous about stopping to ask for information (that can be an intimidating thing for someone to express , \"I want to lose weight- are you taking on new clients?\") Roger was the nicest and most accommodating guy right away, and the client with whom Roger was training at the time was very happy to let me interact. While Roger stepped aside to get one of his business cards for me to contact him later, I asked that current client, \"What do you *really like* about working out with Roger?\" The client said, \"Roger is a GREAT listener and he adapts to your needs.\" For that client, it was a desire to develop self-defense skills, for others, it's boxing training, post-injury rehabilitation, post-birth re-acclimation, etc. For me, it was weight loss. I really wanted someone who could \"meet me where I was\" and develop a plan with me. Based on that client's feedback and how Roger engaged me on introduction, I was confident I was going to enjoy working out with him. Once I started my sessions, I appreciated that Roger gave me \"homework\" (not required, but some activities I could do between our sessions to expedite the results process and build my strength and resistance for our future workouts together). He reached out via text every once in a while as I was establishing my routine (with much invitation to do so, especially concerning my desire to improve my eating habits!), and he gradually moved from a trainer to help me reach fitness goals to also a friend that cared about my wellbeing more than just my fitness success. Over time, my wife also became interested in my workout habits and the fun we were having, that she also began working out with Roger! Since working out with him, I've also learned of two neighborhood friends who have worked out with Roger longer than I have, which was a fun connection to make!  While I had personally experienced how attentive Roger was as a trainer, in early 2020 I saw extensively just how much Roger adapted to my changing needs. I had developed an illness that resulted form specific hormone deficiencies and later that same year, I developed some muscular issues in my right leg. Roger was very accommodating as I had the illness diagnosed, adjusting our workout schedule (suggesting we take a break from our sessions), reintroducing sessions little by little when I was feeling up to it, and once I was in a position to so, tweaking to activities that would support my situation and build my strength and tolerance without draining my system. As I the developed the muscular issues with my right leg, Roger acccomodated by integrating the stretching table into our sessions, and we spent deliberate time with calculated stretched for identifying where the pain points were and what motions to avoid as we advanced. He developed strategies for me to be able to get cardio exercise in without me needing to overwork my right leg, and we deliberately focused more on core and upper body strength when we needed to lay off my right leg. I REALLY appreciate that about Roger. Like the first client with whom I spoke told me - Roger is a very attentive trainer who adapted to my needs. I am grateful for that. Don't be afraid to stop by while Roger is partnering with a current client. I am very glad I did and you will be too."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I've worked out with Roger 3+ years, and highly recommend him!
