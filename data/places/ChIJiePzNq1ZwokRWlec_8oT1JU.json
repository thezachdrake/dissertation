Other than that, this was a horrible hotel experience for us! When we arrived, we were switched rooms at least 3 times. The first was because we were given a key card to a room someone else was already in, which is so awkward and an invasion of privacy! Our bed sheets were dirty when we arrived and the bathroom seemed as though it had not been swept or cleaned very throughly. We asked for clean sheets and a broom to take care of it ourselves. During our 2 day stay they were also replacing all the TVs in the rooms which was difficult because we were working remotely and were interrupted during live meetings for it. The business center was a tiny room that didn't really fit our needs so we couldn't go there either. The workers there are very kind and seem to be trying their best in a really crappy situation. The breakfast is okay and very crowded. Our key cards got deactivated 3 times and we were only there for 2 nights. But worst of all was the elevator situation. You have to plan on around 6-8 minutes at least in order to use the elevator. Is it SO SLOW and there are only 2. The doors randomly would open and stop at floors where no one was. The bottom level of the staircase said that it could be unlocked using your key card, but it only seemed to open with the employee's cards so that ruled out the stairs. And considering we were on the 21st floor, stairs were not something we wanted to do anyways with luggage and such. Overall, it was not a very pleasant experience. Like I said, the workers were kind and were doing the best that they could! This hotel does not meet the standards that I feel most Hampton Inns do though.
