Sinai. The class was held from 10:15am - 4:30pm on a Saturday and the agenda allowed for only a 20 minute break for attendees to grab something to eat for lunch. The majority of the class was traditional lecturer style with projected slides. The instructor spend approximately 30mins talking to each slide which looked like they were copied and pasted from a 1990’s textbook. Since I had read a few pregnancy books prior to taking the course, I did not find the information that particularly new or the style of presentation engaging at all. The last 30 minutes of class was left for hands on practice of baby care skills such as swaddling and burping which I was looking forward to but there were not enough practice dolls per couples so not everyone got the same opportunity to learn. Finally, the class concluded with a relaxation exercise. Overall, I was disappointed in the experience especially for the price of $400. I would not recommend this class to a friend. Instead I would tell them to rent a few books from the library and put the money towards something they need to buy for the baby or a prenatal massage."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Overall, would not recommend to a friend.
