Please note that my experience is limited to the Brazilian Portuguese class with Rosely. It was very disorganized and there seemed to be no structure in terms of learning the language besides watching videos in class ( I can do that on my own). The teacher did not explain grammar properly or even verb conjugation and there was no syllabus. If we got a hw assignment using material we did not have, the teacher would say she would send and never did. I also never received the e textbook that the website states is part of the $300 tuition, despite emailing for a few weeks. The teacher said she would get to it or ignored my requests all together. Every class you go to, the people who attend also somehow seem to change. She also never started class on time because she would wait for more people to come and before you knew it, a half hour of the 1.5 time passed. If your goal is to learn Portuguese, save your money for a more serious school or even duolingo. Shocked this is part of the UN."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"11 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Do not recommend taking a Portuguese lesson class here.
