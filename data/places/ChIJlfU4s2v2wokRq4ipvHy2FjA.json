I bought an Air Conditioner as well as delivery/installation service. I so wanted to support Luis and his local, privately owned business.

In fact, TERRIBLE service!\n\nHe did NOT follow through with anything we agreed with. Initially, he said that he would include taxes in the purchase price and later only tried to make me pay them separately. Moreover, he said that his deliverymen would be able to deliver and replace the A.C. the following day. I repeatedly reminded him at the time of purchase that the location within the window unit would make it more difficult to replace. He reassured me several times saying that his workers can and will replace the A.C. the in the location as the old one, as well as get rid of the old/dysfunctional AC. He said that his workers would also be coming between 12-2 PM the following day.\n\nWhen the next day came around, the delivery/repairmen were late. I had called Luis and his workers several times. Only one deliveryman showed up late - at 4:30, with just a small bag-full of drill bits and a drill. The repairman repeatedly drove back and forth to the store to get more and more tools as he realized he needed them. He also realized that he could not lift the old AC and put the new one in its place due to the location height and the AC’s weight. He then drove again to the store to pickup a store clerk to assist him.\n\nWhen the two deliverymen arrive, they tell me they cannot install the new AC in the old AC’s location as it’s too high up and requires special brackets and housing. As DIY guy with some basic knowledge, I conquered with their assessment, but reminded them that this is part of the full-service installation I paid for and as a result was guaranteed to me. The workers them started to talk in circles and refused to install the AC the way it should have been. I then proceeded to call Luis and briefed him about the situation. He said that since his workers refuse to install the AC the way initially agreed upon, he would NOT force them to do anything. He said that he did not understand the situation at the time of purchase and blamed me for having exceeded his expectations for the job – albeit I explicitly reminded him of it from the get go. I followed saying that that is no way to do business and I had paid for service and thus expect results accordingly. Luis went on and said that he would be OK with just leaving the new AC as and refund the installation fee. I thought it would have been fair, except for the fact that I had been waiting all afternoon for the deliverymen to deliver and install. After some circling around verbal and some quarreling, he hung up the phone on me and called his workers telling them to leave the premises. I then told them to just install as they see fit, as it would have been too much for me to handle alone.\n\nAlso, a manufacturer and store guarantee was issued to me through Luis and his furniture store for one year.
