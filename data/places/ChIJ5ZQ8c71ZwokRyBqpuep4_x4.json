From my first visit, I was blown away by the bedside manner of Dr. Valdes along with his assistant while in the chair. I could tell he had trained his staff in a nonverbal modality through their procedures, while you’re most vulnerable - mouth-open - to promote the relaxation of the patient. I feel calm going to see him, throughout the entire process. He has time to discuss my concerns and a treatment plan, and if I ever have a question as to the next steps they are extremely helpful. They keep excellent notes and details of each visit. I moved 2 hours outside of NYC and keep coming back for all my cleanings, care, etc because my experience visiting the office and with Dr. Valdes is consistently positive, professional, and unequivocally top-notch.
