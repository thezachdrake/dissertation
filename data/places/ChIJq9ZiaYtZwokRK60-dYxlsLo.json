Everything about this hotel is beautiful— the rooms, rooftop, bar, view. It is super clean. The rooms are big, beautifully decorated, and come with blackout curtains. The bed and bedding was super comfy and the shower was lovely. The toiletries provided are high quality and the robes are super comfy. The cleaners were always nice and did a great job (be sure to tip them). The neighborhood was bustling & cute, but not too overwhelming. The only thing I would note is that the pool is pretty small, but I don’t think that’s very important with how amazing everything else was. Stay here!
