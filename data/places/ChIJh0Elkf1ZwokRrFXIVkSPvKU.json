It was my friends first time trying escargot and they also agreed it was super good! We got the scallops, duck, and the filet de Boeuf Rossini. It was okay, I think the scallops were the best out of all three. The duck was alittle smaller than I was expecting. The steak was cooked to perfection but the flavor was okay. I was expecting more black truffle because I love the flavor of black truffle but I only got a hint of it. The crème brûlée was probably the worst I’ve ever tried lol it tasted like vanilla pudding. The pecan tart was quite good though but my friend wasn’t a fan. Overall I had an okay experience. We did get champagne at the end of our meal which was a nice touch and deeply appreciated it!! I just don’t think I would go back unfortunately not for that price point."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Well…this place was kinda a let down.
