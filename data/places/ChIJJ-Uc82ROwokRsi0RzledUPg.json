You can feel the care she has for making it a painless experience AND you can tell she loves what she is doing and that she strives for perfection. She really makes you feel like you are her only patient for the day (as opposed to other doctors who rush to get to the next person.) She talks you through what she is doing and makes the process as pleasant as possible. I left with no pain and am so happy I found her!
