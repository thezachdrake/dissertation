Even then, Yolanda was able to set up a bunch of places for us to look at. Throughout the whole process she was calm and kind, even with all our questions. One thing she really excels at is teaching people about all the ins and outs of moving here. Like I said, it's complicated, however Yolanda always takes the time to explain things really well, and never gets frustrated or annoyed when you don't just know these things. She was able to handle all the paperwork with ease and help us secure our dream apartment. It was truly invaluable having her on our team for moving and I would highly recommend anyone taking her on as a broker."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Yolanda helped me and my wife move to NYC.
