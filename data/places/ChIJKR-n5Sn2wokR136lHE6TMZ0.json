David arrived at our event earlier than the hired time to introduce himself and familiarize himself with our event and what was required with respect to our photography.  The evening went very well and he was very professional with our team members as well as our guests.  We had access to our photos in less than a week of our event with very simple download and access instructions.  The photos David took were AMAZING!
