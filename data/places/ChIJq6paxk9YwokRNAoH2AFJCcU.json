It was empty at first and it continued to be empty for a while but eventually the tables filled-up. Perfect for large groups and the hookah is good and at a very reasonable price. The mimosas and Bellinis were not the strongest but that’s a good thing when you’re there for so long. Overall, highly recommended.
