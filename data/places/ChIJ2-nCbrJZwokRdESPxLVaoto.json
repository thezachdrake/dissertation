The only complaint I have is, each beer can they sell in their bottle shop to go, costs as much as each tap beer you buy while sitting in the joint. My advice is, don’t waste your money buying beer cans to go. The prices are exorbitant!! Do yourself a favor and go to Broadway Dive (Broadway and 101 St).
