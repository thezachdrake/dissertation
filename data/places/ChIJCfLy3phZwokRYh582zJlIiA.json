Had a blast there on a Thursday night from 8-10 pm.  Piano player from 6-9 then another one from 9-midnight.  Then stays open as a fun club until 2 am.  Club Acme is downstairs from 10 to 4 am.  You must dress up A LOT for both places.  Drinks are $20-$27 and food varies a lot.  We posted photos of all the menus with prices so you can see how much because they do not say online.  Loved the hamburger and loved the Gundi which is gnocchi made with ricotta cheese.  Desserts are super great and the smoked salmon app was HUGE.  $99 twice baked potato was worth every penny!!!  Great place we will be back to many times.  LOVED IT!!!!  Check out all of our reviews. If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic.

We firmly believe that his service did not merit even a dollar, let alone the demanded 20%.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of the waiter's rude demeanour, the inflated bill, and the unwarranted pressure to tip left a lasting negative impression on our experience at The Nines.
