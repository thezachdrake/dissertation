This is the second time I’ve had a terrible experience with your app and I refuse to ever use it again. My husband and I dropped off our car today at 12:21 PM our reservation was for 12:30 PM until 7:30 PM., which we prepaid on the SpotHero app. When we went to pick up our car around 6:30 PM we were told we could not pick it up because we dropped it off early. The people at the garage refused to give us our keys and held my phone hostage. When we arrived at 12:21 PM we showed them the reservation that we booked and paid for on SpotHero. Of course at that time, there were no issues with the reservation and they happily took our car and keys and parked our car. They asked us when we would be back and we said between 6:30 PM and 7:30 PM. Everything was OK. Once we came to pick up the car we realized that there was a massive problem. They kept harping on the fact that we dropped off the car at nine minutes early and there was some issue with the ticket, and we had to pay an extra $26 to get our car out of the garage. Why is this? If the price is going to be $46 why didn’t your app say that? Why didn’t your app say that why could not drop your car off early? Thankfully an NYPD officer was walking by the garage as I was on the phone with 911 because we could not get our car keys. The officer was even in disbelief that we couldn’t get our car keys back and that it was a massive problem that we dropped the car off nine minutes early. He had to tell the garage attendance to give our keys back to us since he could see we paid for parking on the app.\nThis is obscenely disturbing and I hope no one ever has to go through this experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I wish I couldn’t leave negative stars.\nThis was a horrific experience.
