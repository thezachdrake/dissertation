I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in the area!"},"publishTime":"2023-02-09T03:06:49Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7269413802915,"longitude":-73.9998337197085},"low":{"latitude":40.7242434197085,"longitude":-74.00253168029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":10,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":19,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":11,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":18,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":11,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":18,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":11,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":18,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":11,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":18,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":10,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":19,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":10,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":19,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Thursday: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Friday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Saturday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Sunday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"436 W Broadway, New York"}
