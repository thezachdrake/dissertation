I've been following citrine rose for a few years after a friend of mine got a top tier color, cut and overall experience.\n\nI booked with the owner, Julie, because if I'm going to do it best believe I'm going to do it w the best! Her hands are blessed, and one thing I will never do is downplay someone's gift. OK!\n\nNow, getting the appointment was one of the first pebbles I tripped on. When I tell you it took way too much time and inquisitions, and this was from the receptionist who was supposed to be the one helping me. Needless to say, mess! But I was determined and planned on landing en la Isla del Encanto (aka Puerto Rico) with a full mane and a fresh cut. So, I pushed through and made me booking! Also, the times available were weird, because apparently the stylist are only in if they know they have a client. Weird but ok.\n\nFinally, the day a baddie (me) was waiting for, my appointment with the grand dame of this natural hair game (iykyk), Julie!\n\nAdmittedly I arrived about 10 minutes late. They saw me right away, but the receptionist booked me for a different service than what we agreed on (another pebblestone). I was taken to the sink for my wash however, miss grand dame did not wash my hair. It was an apprentice who was clearly new. Fine, even though I booked Julie (which was the most costly stylist; I believe around $250) as I know that can be a norm. The wash was nice, but was on the long side. So much so, Julie aka the grand dame, intervened to discuss how long each section of the wash and condition should take.\n\nAlas, we finished and moved to the blow dry chair where next to me sat another client who Julie was working on. Miss mamas was older and her mane was no doubt a product of her experience and consistency. It was gloriously, unlike, my persistent wait. We know how hair works, you can't let it dry out too long after washing it. Additionally, we were heading close to the amount of time they stated it would take and still no Julie whose time I paid for. So, you guessed it, the newbie blow dried my hair and my temper was getting as hot as that heat.\n\nBy the time the blow dry was done, I was fuming. However, I was raised not to act like I got some sense, so I didn't show out but the feelings were written all over my face. After the shampoo, condition, AND blow dry, Julie finally comes over to attend me, and asks what was wrong. As I began to speak, the words and tears flew out as if they were one. I told her how frustrated I was but not receiving the service I paid for. I didn't even think to mentioned time, but I missed this candle making class I paid to attend with a friend because the service took so long.\n\nShe began crying and was very transparent about how hard it's been to find good help which I could empathize with. As we were talking she had to tell a stylist to get off her phone to help a client and then returned back to me with eyes of disbelief. I will say, getting it out and hearing one another definitely healed me through it. I also reveled one of the reasons I booked with her was because of my alopecia and prior experiences with salons. She gave me an amazing cut and the most serene and pain free braid down I have ever experienced IN MY LIFE. For those reasons alone, I am giving 5 stars. I really left at peace, despite the start of the service.\n\nThis appointment was made at the end of august, so I'm hoping the former has been improved. I haven't gone back, but my hair has been THRIVING since my visit and I will be making another appointment in a few weeks. I will update you all about my experience.\n\nHappy new year and protective styling this season to you all."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Started off rocky, end up soft and full.\n\nOkay, so I made this appointment 3 days before a trip.

Her hands are blessed, and one thing I will never do is downplay someone's gift. OK!\n\nNow, getting the appointment was one of the first pebbles I tripped on. When I tell you it took way too much time and inquisitions, and this was from the receptionist who was supposed to be the one helping me. Needless to say, mess! But I was determined and planned on landing en la Isla del Encanto (aka Puerto Rico) with a full mane and a fresh cut. So, I pushed through and made me booking! Also, the times available were weird, because apparently the stylist are only in if they know they have a client. Weird but ok.\n\nFinally, the day a baddie (me) was waiting for, my appointment with the grand dame of this natural hair game (iykyk), Julie!\n\nAdmittedly I arrived about 10 minutes late. They saw me right away, but the receptionist booked me for a different service than what we agreed on (another pebblestone). I was taken to the sink for my wash however, miss grand dame did not wash my hair. It was an apprentice who was clearly new. Fine, even though I booked Julie (which was the most costly stylist; I believe around $250) as I know that can be a norm. The wash was nice, but was on the long side. So much so, Julie aka the grand dame, intervened to discuss how long each section of the wash and condition should take.\n\nAlas, we finished and moved to the blow dry chair where next to me sat another client who Julie was working on. Miss mamas was older and her mane was no doubt a product of her experience and consistency. It was gloriously, unlike, my persistent wait. We know how hair works, you can't let it dry out too long after washing it. Additionally, we were heading close to the amount of time they stated it would take and still no Julie whose time I paid for. So, you guessed it, the newbie blow dried my hair and my temper was getting as hot as that heat.\n\nBy the time the blow dry was done, I was fuming. However, I was raised not to act like I got some sense, so I didn't show out but the feelings were written all over my face. After the shampoo, condition, AND blow dry, Julie finally comes over to attend me, and asks what was wrong. As I began to speak, the words and tears flew out as if they were one. I told her how frustrated I was but not receiving the service I paid for. I didn't even think to mentioned time, but I missed this candle making class I paid to attend with a friend because the service took so long.\n\nShe began crying and was very transparent about how hard it's been to find good help which I could empathize with. As we were talking she had to tell a stylist to get off her phone to help a client and then returned back to me with eyes of disbelief. I will say, getting it out and hearing one another definitely healed me through it. I also reveled one of the reasons I booked with her was because of my alopecia and prior experiences with salons. She gave me an amazing cut and the most serene and pain free braid down I have ever experienced IN MY LIFE. For those reasons alone, I am giving 5 stars. I really left at peace, despite the start of the service.\n\nThis appointment was made at the end of august, so I'm hoping the former has been improved. I haven't gone back, but my hair has been THRIVING since my visit and I will be making another appointment in a few weeks. I will update you all about my experience.\n\nHappy new year and protective styling this season to you all."},"publishTime":"2024-01-11T07:16:34Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7534154802915,"longitude":-73.98752796970848},"low":{"latitude":40.7507175197085,"longitude":-73.9902259302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":2,"hour":9,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":17,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":9,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":17,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":9,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":17,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":9,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":17,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":9,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":16,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: Closed","Tuesday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Wednesday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Thursday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Friday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Saturday: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Sunday: Closed"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"153 W 36th St. 3rd fl, New York"}
