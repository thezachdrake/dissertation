So I had to get dressed and leave my apt to come down to the laundromat because I speak more spanish than my son. I simply asked for assistance because I did not see any water in the machine. Not only did she yell at me saying I had to wait until the machine stopped for her to check the clothes. To which she agreed and put up a bit in service sign on that machine. I asked if she had any soap open because my son had used the last bit on the machine that was broken (which was still in the machine), She yelled at me again saying that my son didn’t put any soap in the machine or any money and that he knew it was broken but put the clothes in there anyway. Several people there offered us soap and apologized to me for that woman’s behavior. This is literally the 5th time she had yelled at me because a machine wasn’t working and I ask for either the money or in this case detergent. Because it is close by, I have continued to go.
