I've wanted to write about Jose for some time, but it took a while for me to explain how much his guidance and support mean to me.  Let me start out with the basics:  Working out with Jose is like working out with a very knowledgeable, supportive and motivational friend. He is always on time and ready to greet me with a big smile. In fact, I am running late most mornings because I am a night owl trying to become a morning person, but he is ever so patient with me. He is extremely professional, accommodating and very respectful. Over the last few months working with him, he has helped me become strong in both muscle and spirit. I have sciatica that can be very crippling at times, but he is always ready with modifications and I never experience a flare after working out with him. By the end of every workout, I am always limping, but never too sore to continue. I leave with a feeling of accomplishment and am always excited to come back next time.\n\nI've lost count of how many times I've started and stopped working out in the past. I had personal trainers before, but I never went back more than twice.  I think it's because I always needed someone who was more than a personal trainer, and that is Jose!  He has not only motivated me to find the physical strength I never knew I had, he has also helped me overcome my mental blocks during my worst bouts of depression. He genuinely cares about all of his clients, and he is passionate about helping people find their strength. I am honored to have the privilege of training with him. This is the best investment I've ever made in my whole life, and I hope I can continue to work with him for a long time!  Thank you so much Jose!
