The Old Man had walked by before and liked the look of the place, and I have to share those sentiments for sure - it feels like an antique store in many ways. We didn't spend a ton of time indoors other than to request outdoor seating and take a bathroom break, but neither of us would have had an issue hanging out in there for the duration of our adventure.

I'm not typically an advocate for a cocktail that's more than $15, but if you're going to spend that kind of money, you should be able to appreciate/distinguish multiple layers of flavors, which is certainly the case here. You can tell that the bartender/mixologist knew what they were doing when they prepped it, and that the bar manager or whomever designed this drink did so with care. There's a lot of subtlety and attention to detail, and I'd definitely advocate thoughtful sips versus casual gulps.\n\nThe service was fine. Your mileage may vary on this, but when we got there it looked like the bartender inside was literally the only one handling drink orders for all tables including the outdoor area. We were seated quickly and provided with menus at the time, but after 10 minutes or so went by without a visit, I had to go inside to give our orders. Not a huge deal, and it wasn't difficult to hail him down behind the bar to do so, but overall we had to be a bit more proactive than I think you'd ideally want to be.
