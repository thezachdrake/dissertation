My purchasing journey, from start to finish, was excellent. Despite lacking any prior purchase history, I was treated like a VIP customer. It was a relaxed Saturday afternoon when my wife and I visited the boutique to explore the differences between the world's oldest luxury leather goods maison and the renowned trio of handbag brands (unnamed here, assuming familiarity within Delvaux's domain). My Sales Associate, Yexuan, was professional and enthusiastic in showcasing Delvaux's bag collection. We delved into Delvaux's history and the evolution of the luxury goods industry. It's unfortunate that sales staff often prioritize the brand's ideology over cooperation. While I understand not every boutique operates the same way, I'm pleased that my experience with Yexuan and Delvaux on New York City's 5th Avenue was flawless. Instead of solely focusing on sales, they aim to convey Delvaux's essence. From being the oldest leather goods house with just three workshops in Belgium and France to having approximately 70 boutiques worldwide, one might mistakenly perceive Delvaux as exclusive and difficult to access, akin to Patek Philippe or Hermès due to its marketing strategy. The notion of requiring a purchase history to acquire a specific item is absurd, implying one's money isn't valued here. Essentially, Delvaux is an exceptional brand with a rich history, and the dedicated people behind the company take pride in their work. I believe everyone should have the freedom to buy items that bring them joy in life, and there's nothing wrong with paying a premium for luxury items, but it's not necessary to prove success. If you seek instant recognition, Delvaux might not be your best bet, as even a shopping bag from Target or Stop & Shop is more recognizable. However, if you desire quiet luxury and dependable service, I highly recommend visiting Delvaux on New York City's 5th Avenue if you're in the area. It's a must-visit spot in Manhattan that everyone deserves to experience genuine customer service. While I can't definitively say Delvaux produces the best bags globally due to subjectivity, my luxury shopping experience with Delvaux surpassed that of any other handbag brand."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Delvaux operates around 70 stores globally, and fortunately, there's one right in New York City, allowing me to experience it firsthand.
