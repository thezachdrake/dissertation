I'm taking time to leave this feed back because I have seen a few negative comments.\nYou need to understand that this agency works with private owners. The agency is not responsible to how a home owner takes care of their home. Private rooms rent out on a weekly basis. You will need to pay the agency upfront before they will provide you with any listings. This is legit. They will put you in contact with home owners immediately. The point is for you to move in that day. There will be options, but that really all depends on what your budget and preference are. I was given options and got the opportunity to go to each place to meet and inspect the room before confirming. If you aren't satisfied with what is being offered that day, you can wait and keep looking till you do find a place. Delta Room Rental also offers a 14 day grace period...if, for whatever reason the place you're staying is not to your satisfaction, you can request for a new listing without having to pay an additional service fee, but you have to do it before two weeks. Don't wait till the last minute. The agency is willing to help you if the home owner is the one making you move out. This just happened to me right when I fell on the 14 day mark. Delta Room Rental quickly responded and got me in touch with another home owner without charging a service fee, (THANK YOU). I've lived in two different room and about to move into my 3rd. The home owners who I've chosen are very kind and keep a clean home. All of them are in uptown Manhattan...more bragging rights to say I live in Manhattan, plus it's still within my budget (all of which have been under $700 a month). Everyone will have a different experience because there's so many different types people who live in NYC. You don't have to settle on a place you don't like. You're not obligated to secure the 1st room you're given...trust me, I've seen some not so great places....one lady wanted $200 a week and her place had roaches and I wasn't allowed to use the kitchen at all. I had to keep my food in my room. She didn't even provide bed linen....you can guess I didn't take that option. I highly recommend Delta Room Rental because the staff is patient and friendly. They will listen to your needs and help you find what you're looking for...you will need to make the effort in going to the places and meeting the home owners. NYC is a truly magical city.

In January 2016, coming from Netherlands to New York City to study 5 months, i had to find a place i could stay in Manhattan that wasn't expensive. (Yeah I'm a very naively optimistic guy and I'm proud of that.) I didn't want to secure a place online before my arrival in US because of the many scams on internet i discovered. So i decided to stay in a hostel for the first 2 weeks and start my search from there. After spending so much time on internet, i became really desperate and frustrated. No way i would ever find a place around 700$ in Manhattan. I then found delta rooms somewhere on the 10th Google results page. (Lol) I don't remember why but i decided to visit their office, which at the time (2016!) looked quite shady ahah. Some latino lady tells me to fill in a form and pay $150 or 200$ upfront, which i found odd but i did anyway. I did receive a proof of payment. She then literally gives me 3 small pieces of paper with addresses scribbled on. She also tells me that if neither of those 3 options appealed to me, i could come back and ask for new ones. I was very skeptical about this but i didn't have much choice i had already realized. Option 1: large room in Harlem in a clean apartment of an Ecuadorian family: father, mother and their son who was my age. There was a double bed plus a lot of space around it. That was 750$ dollar/month. Option 2: was dirty and there was a dog barking very loudly. Option 3: small room with only a bed and no space to even stand haha. Option 2 & 3 were around 800-850$ if i remember correctly. They gave me some days to think about my choices. I obviously took option 1 and that was really great. My room was right when you entered the apartment on the right side, next to that was the bathroom, next the kitchen. Then; there was the living room and bedrooms at the end of the apartment but i didn't have to go there as i only needed the bathroom and kitchen. I never had any problems with the family, never any disturbance. They were really kind. I had beers with their son at a bar once or twice to watch a game. I think we reached a personal agreement for that room that was lower than the original: 700$/month instead of the 750$. And the location was great; just 10 mins or so to Times Square with the metro. Why this review? Because unlike all of the other agencies i came across, this one was simple and easy: \"you pay once, we help you find a place\". No complicated structures or credit check BS or ridiculous fees/ prices or hidden info or whatever nonsense. Having said that, i can only speak from my own personal experience. Maybe I was very lucky with my place, i don't know. Either way, i was quite happy they took a heavy burden off my shoulders in an instant.
