I can tell you firsthand that Steve and his team were instrumental in reducing the condominium’s arrears from over $160,000 to under $20,000 in a few years!  He achieved similar success at the HOA, having reduced arrears from a peak of over $42,000 to zero over a several year period.  In my 20+ years in serving on board leadership roles, I have worked with dozens of legal firms (both big and small) from around the tri-state area.  Collections are a difficult, but critical area to tackle (and especially so during current challenging times).  Winning the court cases is only half the battle.  Collecting the money is the more difficult (and most important) part.  Steve’s firm stands out from other attorneys and has been highly effective in turning around outstanding debt for the two communities referenced above.  From my perspective, he has attained such a remarkable track record by combining his expert knowledge with 'street smarts' and innovative techniques.  The results speak for themselves.  His firm wins the cases and collects the money.  For example, in one difficult case, Steve guided us on how to successfully rent out an abandoned unit (which also suffered from a defective title and hence it took years for the bank to foreclose) in order to recover over $25,000 in arrears.  In several other cases, his team sent collection letters directly to tenants of rented units to intercept rent payments where landlords continued to collect rent, but failed to pay common charges.  In several other cases, his team was successful in locating and freezing bank account assets and also in executing wage garnishments.  In several others, they guided the board on procedures for revoking \"common privileges\" (such as assigned parking spaces and pool passes) as leverage for collecting arrears.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  Steve and his team are very experienced and utilize a variety of creative methods for producing results.  That being said, it is not always possible to collect money even after winning a court judgment - so it's important to assess each situation before making large investments in legal action.  Steve has always been forthright in telling us if it does not make sense to commence with larger actions (such as foreclosure) and he has also utilized small claims processes very efficiently, where appropriate.  Besides collections, Steve and his team have also processed numerous bylaw amendments, as well as serving as general counsel to the communities on a variety of other challenging items (ie: emotional support animals, environmental issues, liability exposure, etc).\n\nIn summary, I have worked with Steve Lasser for over 14 years now.  He is an outstanding attorney and I highly recommend you consider retaining his firm’s services.  I am confident that his team would quickly become an asset to your community!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have a longstanding business relationship with Stephen Lasser, as I've been working closely with him since 2009 on a variety of legal matters through my board roles as the Vice President of a 170 unit, 12 acre condo complex and as the President of a 50 home, 8 acre HOA, both located in Fishkill, New York.\n\nSteve and his legal team were hired to clean up significant levels of arrears in both communities after previous attorneys failed to make any tangible progress across a high number of cases over years.
