She has also begun to try and use found objects (such as a paper box) to create new things (such as a fire truck).  Every week at Osher she conducts real, hands-on science experiments.  She often comes home asking if we can replicate the experiments.  For example, one day she asked if we could do experiments with ice at home after trying to see how fast ice would melt at school when it was placed in different temperature liquids.  At Osher, I feel that she is learning through multiple modalities.  For example, she sings, dances, does yoga, paints, plays, builds, listens to stories in both Hebrew and English, and runs outside plenty.  I love that she is so active at school.  I also love that the teachers not only are not afraid to get messy, but they actually encourage messy work.  Painting, sculpting with clay and cooking are the norm there.
