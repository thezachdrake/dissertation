The work on Instagram is very nice, but it is all smoke and mirrors. I do not recommend going to this salon. I texted Adji to schedule an appointment and paid a deposit; although she was very accommodating regarding the scheduling, she lacked professionalism. When I arrived at the salon, Adji charged me an additional $30 to blow dry my hair even though she previously told me it wasn't necessary. Additionally, Adji could not achieve the style I requested, noting that she could not do stitch braids, although \"her\" work on Instagram showed otherwise. She noted that all the work on her page was not hers, and based on my experience, it appears most of the work may not be hers, which is very misleading.\n\nTo make matters worse, I paid $380 for a \"human hair\" boho bob, but the hair began tangling and coming out of the braids almost immediately. Even though I have tight 4C curls and frequently get my hair done, I had to remove the braids after just one week because the tangling was unmanageable, and the synthetic hair began to unravel. Adji took 8 hours to complete the bob and took four breaks, once to take a 45-minute call and three times to eat; please keep in mind that I was told I wasn't allowed to eat in front of the salon. She even got upset when I asked her not to stop again to try on new outfits.\n\nUltimately, I regret traveling from Brooklyn for such mediocre and overpriced service. I hope this post helps someone else avoid the same experience. Instead, I recommend going to a salon on 125 or elsewhere."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I recently visited this stylist that I found on Instagram and had a terrible experience.
