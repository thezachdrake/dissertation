The venue was packed and cold but after entering the building honestly you would forget all about that. They had lots of places to take pics and videos and the artwork was very very detailed and very beautifully done. I would highly recommend anyone and everyone to visit whenever they are in town and if the Big Apple Circus 🎪 is open because I believe it’s a seasonal event but I’m not sure, you can Google it just to be sure and for more info. The bathroom was outdoors though and it was freezing in NYC that day so bear in mind that you will need a nice jacket to keep you warm.  My daughter is 12 and she was very happy with the show from start to finish. It’s a very kid friendly show that parents along with their children will definitely enjoy watching. There’s also a concession area where you can take pics, buy food and gifts and merchandise from the show. You will also see the actors walking by in the concession area (picnic area) where they would take pics with the kids or anyone who asks for a photo. The actors were very nice and social and the staff were very professional and helpful. Enjoyed every minute of this experience and recommend everyone to go see it especially with the kids.
