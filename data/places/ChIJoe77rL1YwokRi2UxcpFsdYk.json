I probably should have stopped the process there but I was a bit confused about what was going on and thought perhaps they were transitioning between the two.\n\nThe color: A full head of highlights took an hour and 40 minutes to place. The process was remarkably slow in comparison to the usual 40 minutes I am accustomed to. Afterwards my hair was streaky, orange, with persistent dark roots (see photos). It looks entirely unnatural and nothing like the photos I presented them with. I communicated this to them and they offered to fix it but the process took so long I had to leave.\n\nThe cut: The right side is longer than the left overall an Asymmetric haircut.\n\nThe blowout: The technique used to blow out my hair was archaic. No products were  placed in my hair to protect it and the stylist proceeded to scorch my hair and fry it- inevitably causing severe damage. A portion of my scalp also burned in the process and a day later it remains red, painful, and is starting to peel.\n\nThe Cost: My friend who has been going to this salon for years told me she pays $65 for a haircut and $200 for her highlights. I received a bill for $410- $290 for highlights and $120 for a cut. I questioned this and they insisted it was the correct amount. After tip I paid $500 for the worst hair experience I have ever had. Why I received a much higher price than my friend is unclear and the team was unwilling to explain this to me.\n\nCustomer service: The staff was actually quite kind and willing to fix the issues. However given the fiat pricing and the terrible hair color and scalp burning I elected not to return to have my hair fixed.\n\nOverall: Horrible, hideous unnatural coloring that took an excessively long amount of time to do.
