Perfect for date night or a meet up with friends. Since we were waiting a bit over 10 minutes, the manager gave us free glasses of champagne which I thought was nice! Shortly after, we were seated.\n\nSince I've wanted to visit for a while, I already knew what I was ordering. But let's get into the apps and drinks. They give you complimentary bread and dip while you browse through the menu. There was a special for their fried mozzarella trio which comes with 3 sauces (pesto, marinara, vodka). I love how we were able to try different sauces. For the drinks, I love a good spritz so I had to order the limoncello spritz. It was light and refreshing! For my entrée, of course I had to order the spicy rigatoni alla vodka and boy was it GOOD! The cheese, the sauce and seasoning went together perfectly. This spot has become my #1 for spicy rigatoni alla vodka! SO glad I took my leftovers home because it was just as good. My boyfriend ordered their chicken parm and devoured every bite on his plate.
