He did a very quick & rough cleaning which felt like he didn’t do anything at all. Didn’t even offer me a napkin to wipe the fluoride off of my face. The dentist equipment did not look clean at all. It’s only 1 small exam room, When you are in the room, the door is left cracked open and everyone in the waiting room can hear your business. I did not like my experience and I would never return. If you are in search of a new dentist, I suggest that you 100% skip this place!!
