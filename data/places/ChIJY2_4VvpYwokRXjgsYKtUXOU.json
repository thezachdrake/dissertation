Upon our arrival, we were escorted in by the doormen and seated in front of the bar area. They brought us fried olives, homemade chips and mixed nuts, each item was served warm and fresh. From there they take your drink orders then you are escorted downstairs to the dining area and the entire place is a vibe. We started with popovers and we ordered Caesar salad, vegan burgers, burgers and choc cake for dessert. Best vegan burger I have tried.
