When I first walked into the shop, I was greeted by a twinge of neighborhood-y fantasia. ‘Could this be my new *spot*?’ I thought to myself. The wall-length cooler is filled with dozens and dozens of beers, both cases and single bottles & cans. There are pints of Van Leuwen and pints of a brand of alcoholic ice cream anchoring either side. The menu is affordable and expansive, offering everything from the store’s namesake to yet a third option of ice cream, courtesy of their Baskin-Robbins-style set-up. They sell cookies and mochi and even Korean street food, too, all for just a few bucks each. Plus, there’s a clean, well-kept bathroom, which isn’t always easy to find (or appreciate) in the city. However, in the midst of my hearty, hungry hope, I neglected to acknowledge one crucial detail about the store: It was totally empty on a Friday night.\n\nI ordered the double cheeseburger combo and added American cheese (because they don’t offer cheddar), pickles, and caramelized onions, all to be nestled inside of a brioche bun. Plus the order comes with fries and a soda, all for under $15 (it’s cheaper in store than on DoorDash, but I had a coupon). The woman behind the counter was friendly. When my order was ready (I waited about 10-15 minutes from the time of placing it), she emerged from the back grill area with a serving tray and asked me if it was here or to-go. It was then that I should have realized that it felt not unlike when the lunch lady handed you your daily pathetic, pre-prepared pile of pasturage in high school, because Burgers & Shake Co is nothing more than cafeteria food.\n\nThe bun was dry enough to use it as a compostable alternative to cinder blocks. The sauce and condiments saturated the sandwich so much that every bite was a struggle to not rapid-fire eject the patties onto the table. And the meat tasted like anything but; the all-too-familiar ‘petals’ or rounded edges that decorated the burgers back in high school were instantly, terrifyingly recognizable, having emerged from some freezer-burned level of hell. The patty had no flavor other than a whisper of processed smoke and crumbled into spongey slivers with each bite. I couldn’t taste any of the other toppings, either, because they all eventually ended up on either my hands, the ground, or the wrapper. I couldn’t eat more than half of it until I began feeling genuinely unwell. The crinkle fries tasted like traumatic middle school lunches, too, and lost about 99% of their quality (what little there was) the moment they hit room temp.\n\nI know I can be dramatic (hence my bio). This is just some burger shop out of a million in New York. This probably doesn’t matter. But what does matter is that something as simple as just a ‘burger shop’ can’t even get the most basic, elemental, entirely-human snack food right. Its disgusting. Its lazy. It would be criminal if Google Maps reviews could ever be used as evidence in court. It only tarnishes this beautiful, vibrant part of Manhattan that has so many other delicious restaurants to try. It’s not worth your time, your money, your appetite, or anymore of my words other than these:\nIf nobody else is in there, you probably shouldn’t be, either."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I only just recently moved to the area and am slowly building out my list of regular haunts.
