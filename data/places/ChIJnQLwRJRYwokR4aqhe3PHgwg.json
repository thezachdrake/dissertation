I didn’t take my clues seriously enough and rebooked even though he wouldn’t be in again for a month.  It wasn’t because he was on a holiday. It was because this is how he runs his business. He’s hardly there. You’re not advised when you are a new client until it’s too late.  And you need a haircut then.    I went to the salon of my late hairstylist John Barrett of 25 years and asked for a stylist. I went back to Frederic on December 12, they canceled my December 5.  It took four calls to finally get an appointment.  They kept putting me on hold.  I decided there maybe a list of preferential clients and I’m not one of them.  My 75th birthday was on the 9th AND I am not used to a bad hair day especially on my birthday. He was  annoyed with me. He said my hair looked terrible. He said it had too many layers.  I wish I left the chair in that moment.  Instead I took his patriarchal abuse and told him I tried desperately to get an appointment with him. I stayed for my pedicure, manicure and make up appointments following his. I later learned he comes in specifically for clients AND he only has a few.  I understood that without knowing.   I had the sense there is a preferential clients’ list AND I’m not on it.  While I’m waiting for Fekkai the manicurist asks, “ would you like to have a manicure later.”   I looked at her in disbelief and said, “  I have a pedicure and manicure scheduled following this haircut.”   After my first haircut with Frederic Fekkai he said, “You’re a changed woman.” I thought it’s a cute haircut. I wouldn’t go that far.  My thought, he has a big EGO!  I wasn’t wrong.\n\nMy experience is that Fekkai is an arrogant unfriendly driven “Type A frequency” guy who lacks compassion.  He is rough unkind abusive  in a sea of a poorly trained unprofessional staff in an equally poor designed small salon unable to accommodate a high end clientele with dignity and grace.  When it was time for me to have my pedicure, Fekkai was in the small space  sitting on the one bench sprawled across the bench having his lunch.  I had to wait in the lounge while he finished his lunch during my appointment time.\n\nPlease do not call me.  We clearly are on a different frequency.  I am coming from a place of love, compassion and heart.  I am sending you compassion, love and heart for your journey while on this planet!\n\nMay you see the light!\n\nSome snapshots of what love compassion and heart look like.
