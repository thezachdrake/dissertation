Williams claims that Rivera's violent, terrorist crimes were \"the tools of a cause...used to fight for one's freedom\" despite the fact (a fact of which Williams seems to be completely unaware) that Puerto Rico regularly holds referendums in which the general population votes to determine the future of their Island.
