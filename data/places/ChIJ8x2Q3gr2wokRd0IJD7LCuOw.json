I had my 14 year old in this school and now my 6 year old. Both principles are great and always take care of business with urgency and with care. The location is fine it’s better then let’s say being on 116th st I have never had problems with anyone harassing me and the crossing guard is always on the corner making sure the kids are safe. The M1 bus is right in the front of the school so once you get your child you can get the bus and go home or walk up and take the two train or the 102 bus or walk down and get the 6 train on Lexington. IEPs are handled quickly and directed to the person that will help you with information and support to get the ball rolling for your child. Mrs. Jasmine God rest her soul was a great dance teacher she is missed dearly. The love and care that you get from the staff is felt. Even to the activities that the staff but together is done with love and you never feel as if they are bothered to stay late to make sure we enjoy ourselves with our child. I give this school 5 hearts and yes they will call ACS is they see a concern but as they should do as this world is becoming we never know and always want to take care our children and it’s always better to be safe then sorry later."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This school is a great school.
