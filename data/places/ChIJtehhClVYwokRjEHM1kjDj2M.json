There are over 900 seats in this intimate setting leaving not much elbow room so you may want to sit at the ends of the aisles.\n\nGrey House was definitely not like any other Broadway show I’ve seen. I’d describe it as a psychological thriller with some moments of comedy to break up the heaviness of the plot.  You absolutely must pay attention to every detail, the set, wardrobe, lighting, music, every single word.  There are clues in every scene that build up to a very extraordinary and emotional ending, if you are able to piece together the story you will truly shed tears at the end. The cast was amazing and it was great to see Laurie Metcalf on stage. This is a show that would probably reveal more if you watch it more than once.  So sad that it closed the final curtain this weekend. I hope there are more shows like this in the future.
