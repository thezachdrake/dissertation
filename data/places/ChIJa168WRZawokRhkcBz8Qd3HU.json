I have significant experience with attorneys and I have found Mr. Forestal’s knowledge and behavior to be sub-standard.

Preparing an invoice is clearly not billable time, but he refuses to provide a credit for the amount charged. This forced me to file a fee dispute with the New York State Bar Association. To add to the situation, Mr. Forestal has not yet returned the funds remaining from the retainer. I told Mr. Forestal that I no longer needed his services on January 2. He refused to provide a final invoice until January 15. Notwithstanding my several requests to receive the refund check promptly, as of today (February 10), Mr. Forestal has not yet sent me a check.
