She said \"why did the ATM machine run ourt of hundred dollar bills?'  That was an odd thing to ask a customer also because she was not busy and was simply chatting and laughing with two of her other colleagues.  I was wondering if Chase paid her to chat and laugh with her colleagues or to help customers with their requests.  Throughout my time there she was rude, cocky and muttering under her breath.  She reluctantly gave me the hundred dollar bills and before I could put forward my second request she just stopped helping me which meant that I had to take out my ATM card for a second time.  I think Victoria definitely needs more training in how to deal with customers and people in general because working at a bank being a teller or a manager means being polite and knowing how to deal with customers with respect.
