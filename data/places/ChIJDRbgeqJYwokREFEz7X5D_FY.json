respects each and every person's ability, efforts, goals and outcome.  If I can help and empower people there, great but it's not up to me to decide if I'm really helping others or doing something to empower others.  All I can do is put myself out there and do what I'm supposed to do there.  It's all up to the receiving end to decide whether the things I do work for them or not.  I see Achilles as the most diverse and inclusive group that supports each other, empowers each other and inspires growth in others.   When I started coming to Achilles through New York Cares, I think around the end of  2017, I was only comfortable with slow jogs.  I challenged myself to pair up with Achilles runners who wanted to run the 6 mile loop and also upped my pace so that the athlete I paired up with wouldn't get bored.  There were times an Achilles runner invited me to run an extra 6 mile loop after I came back from my first 6 mile run with another runner.  I would take up on those opportunities.  End of March 2019, me and a blind runner both ran 20 miles when I just decided to let the other person put in as miles (s)he wanted to put in.  In May 2019, I completed my first 50K ultramarathon before the cutoff time and that same blind runner who put in 20 miles ran his/her first ultramarathon about a year after I did.  Until covid hit, I came to Achilles once or twice a week.  I was very consistent.  After covid hit, I ran/walked with Achilles athletes outside of the Achilles workout days on and off.  One of the biggest reasons why I wanted to keep on coming back to Achilles was because I would see improvement in someone every time I went there.  I had a great time guiding in the NYC Half Marathon this year.  I would like to run with Achilles whenever I can work it in my schedule and look forward to guiding in future races and marathons."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Great place for runners of all levels who want to find common interests and common grounds with like-minded people in a very inclusive group that respects each and every person's ability, efforts, goals and outcome.
