This driving school schedules the road tests in New Rochelle, the speed limit is faster there (30 mph vs the 10-25 here in Inwood).\n\nI took my first exam in August 2023 with the other driving school in the area. The experience left me unsettled because the instructor there was quick to temper. I do not respond well to being yelled at, especially in confined spaces. It made me realize how important it is to be comfortable and build trust with an instructor.\n\nLuckily I found that with Greg Myers. He's a little kooky, but a good bean. He's got toy cars, a clipboard, and a tape measure. He will measure out how far you are from the curb when parking, and even find the right angle/ cue for your perspective in a car. I am very short, so that helped a lot. He'll help you gain a spatial awareness of a car in motion, and how your actions behind a steering wheel look on the road. He readily gives feedback on what you're doing - wrong or right. It helped me build confidence.\n\nIn total I took 13 lessons with him. (I combined some of them for 1 longer 90 min sessions). Sometimes he's a little over zealous with the brake, especially when starting out, but I get it, the instructor brakes are there for a reason and he's not trying to die. Especially useful since I always feel a pinch in my stomach when I have to accelerate backwards when parking on a hill. In his words \"I've got you\". Thats what I need in a teacher, and Greg delivered.\n\nIf you're anything like me, and need someone with patience and grace, give Greg a try."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"One of my new years resolution for 2023 was to get my drivers license.
