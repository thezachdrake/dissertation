After 40 minutes, the waitress came over and told my friend they only had small pieces of calamari that was at the bottom of the bag and asked her if she still wanted it. My friend said no and chose to get the buffalo wings instead. After almost an hour, our food comes out and the jerk wings I ordered were cold and the size of pigeon wings. The jerk chicken empanadas would have been good had there been chicken in it. All you tasted was crust and cheese and they gave you jerk sauce on the side.

Walked in bartender informed us the waitress was not in yet and to sit where we wanted. We decided to have the bartender who by the way was the sweetest person ever take our order. Looked at the menu and decided to order and almost everything we order was not available. Appetizer: No Calamari or Ackee and Saltfish. Ok lets do Entree. Entree: No stew chicken, no escovitch fish (sigh). Side order: No white rice again (sigh). I mean why are you even open then. Frozen machine for drinks was not working either ( No frozen Hennesy). Ordered oxtail tacos ( oxtail meat was cold and the tortilla was cold). Entree ordered jerk chicken. Chicken leg was pink and luke warm, cabbage was cold and only the rice was hot as if thats the only part of the food they microwaved. Curry Shrimp entree came in a little skillet in which the skillet was cold. It was like they just decided to dump the shrimp in it without actually heating the skillet up. Again the cabbage was cold and the vegetable rice temperature wise was luke warm. After the meal we were told the calamri was ready and if we wanted it we declined. The bartender again who waa sweet said she will provide it for free because of our experience but we declined. The food was mediocre and I only came here due to what I saw on Instagram thinking this place would be it. It was not.\nOn another note a young lady walked in with this red and blonde wig, which I assumed was the waitress with her bubble jacket on. She was behind the bar with her jacket and pink purse. Then i saw her make herself a drink in what looked like a Champagne flute and she drank that drink by the bar. How unprofessional. I watched her the whole time i was there since me and my friend was the only one there besides one gentleman at the bar until we were almost done then 3 ladiea walked in. The waitress looked like she was only there for her drinks. Thank goodness we were serve by the bartender. To sum it all up I would not be returning. I had better tasting food at my local Jamaican restaurant."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I went to the restaurant this past Wednesday around 4pm with a friend.
