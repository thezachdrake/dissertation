Well I missed the early show, so I missed the pizza, but I attended the late show and was not disappointed. I entered the loft from the street, and for an unmarked loft, it was relatively easy to find. The buzzer was well labeled. Upon getting there, maybe 10 mins early, the space wasn't very crowded (though it would be packed by the time the show started). I was concerned about whether or not I'd be able to have a drink inside, but this fear was unnecessary. The staff was helpful and overall I enjoyed the venue. The venue: is one large room filled with seats with a meager stage in front. There is tech in the back. There is a small room that serves as a waiting room for the comics and a space where you can order water, etc.  A hallway and a single bathroom (which surprisingly, I never had to wait much to use). The comics: were really good. I expected people to be trying out new material and routines but it felt more like they were just polishing their routines, if that. Several of the comics had better deliver than their TV performances of the same material. When one comic was clearly trying things out, it made for funny awkwardness... The audience was never not entertained. I would definitely catch this show again. Tickets were around $10, no drink/food minimum, good audience, it's tough to beat."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I visited Secret Loft for Secret Loft Comedy, a show that promised free pizza and no drink minimum, so I figured I had nothing to lose.
