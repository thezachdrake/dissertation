The guide was fabulous. I wanted to get a behind the scenes look at Elllis Island and this was definitely worth the extra fee and the time. Our guide gave us plenty of time to take pictures and roam the rooms that she took us to. I don’t think I would’ve known nearly as much about the history of the buildings and the people who came through Ellis Island if it wasn’t for this tour. The fact that there were only 12 of us on the tour also helped because we were able to ask many questions without feeling rushed. We were on the last tour so when we were done, we were able to still go through the main building, but only had a limited amount of time. If you want to go through the main building and read all of the history, and watch the film then I recommend that you book the tour either early or arrive at the island at least an hour ahead of your tour. We went on the Friday of Christmas week, but I was told that this is always a busy place to visit. We got our tickets online which made the process of getting on the ferry going to the Statue Of liberty Island then catching the ferry to Ellis Island so much easier. And I also recommend getting the tickets at least a few days if not a week early, the tours do seem to sell out depending on the tour company that you buy it from. The view of Manhattan is spectacular in the evening as you are arriving on the ferry."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This tour made the experience so much better.
