The registration was done easily. You can walk into this centre with a referral or not, you don't need to have medical insurance or Medicaid. All you need is just your Photo I.D which could be your International Passport or IDNYC among others. This centre is the New York Department of Health and Hygiene. They provide TB screening and confirmation screening including HIV screening to all clients whether interested or not.\n\nThe staff at the registration desk are lovely and very respectful. They provide follow up calls in a friendly manners, though thy speak too fast to be understood by an African. Sometimes I feel maybe this call is from a robotic machine programmed to call my names and remind me of my appointment. The nurse is good, respective and supportive.\n\nMy experience here, I tested negative for TB here, having tested positive for the TB blood work initially, I was given a clearance letter that stated that I have no TB and I am not infectious and not dangerous to others.\n\nThough I was recommended to start an INH. I wanted to see my primary Doctor who referred me here to discuss the result of the X-ray done and the possibility of treatment if any, but this centre will not leave any chance, they requested I start the INH initiation as soon as possible. This I see as against my right as a patient, but as a new mmigrant, I don't know if I have any rights as a patient. Also for the fact that I needed to get immuned against active TB in the future, I needed the treatment, though I was just not ready for it at the time.\n\nI have worked at a HIV Clinic having a co-location with TB center and had several interactions with my clients at the General Hospital, Lagos Island for two years. I might have been exposed to TB based on my daily treatment adherence and treatment access activism with clients.\n\nOne of the men toned skinned HIV testers approached me at the corner, maybe got a signal from his colleagues he insisted I take an HIV test, I told him that was not the reasons why I came here. He has a bad manners as he was insisting I have to take the test that it is  necessary, I asked him if HIV test is no longer voluntary. He forced me in a way, I went with him to his testing room which doesn't look like a counseling room, because he doesn't make me feel comfortable with the presence of all the niddles and HIV testkids. When he finished talking he said it is voluntar, and I picked on him, I said thank you for telling me again that it is voluntar, I am not interested to do this text and I left his office.\n\nSometimes they could play on your intelligence and for the fact that they know you are new, they pretend you have no rights to refused services and even treatment. This is a terrible experience for me as I am been force to take treatment here.\n\nMost Africans are either TB infected or HIV Positive as the two diseases are predominantly presence in the Continent.That shouldn't be the reasons why your patients should be subjected to a forced treatment. If I am Latino, black or brown, don't see my skin color, see me as a customer who deserves respect and dignity.\n\nDon't pretend you love me, by forcing me to have screening or treatment, I am a human being and not just a number for counting. The centre should improve on their communication and relationship with the clients. The HIV testers should go for counseling training. There should be posters and or signs that shows TB and HIV relationship. Clients should have a right to choose to be tested or not. Clients should be counsel enough to choose to start treatment or not."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Was here for a chest X-ray.
