Students are not held accountable for their learning or their behavior. There is very little support from admin when it is needed. Teachers are not given enough time to complete any tasks they are assigned. Tasks are assigned back to back and at times without a real reason. No discipline; parents and students run the school; released all teachers that were there over three years; the physical space is cramped- four hundred and fifty students middle through high on the third and forth floor of a former high school; stand in line to clock out, using their palm reading punch clock; long, unstructured hours for teachers; two and three teachers assigned to one classroom; inconsistent and poorly planned school events (often canceled at the last minute); poor communication between management, behavioral team and teaching staff; wrong behavior program in use; students disciplined according to social/status/favoritism; staff/student personal issues not heeded; admin supports student over staff; teacher evals done according to personal like/vendetta; not all eval decisions based from principal observations; reimbursement request needed for \"buy box\"/activities; forth floor walk up-need health note to request elevator key; ;One minute late- 5 times: write up 9 times: terminated; No curriculum maps; lack of books and resources; no library; no computer lab; overabundance of frustrated teachers at the end of each day."},"publishTime":"2018-07-13T20:06:16Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJd3cUExf2wokRadBc1NHP66Y/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZNm9ESTlBRRAB","rating":5,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLGxtOjtEnAJqU14oaDaB_hU0Ev6oLISDj87G_qqIz3=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114443001840724459693/reviews","displayName":"Allie O"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Best school ever my daughter previously went to democracy prep then I switched her to opportunity and she just excelled there they have so many opportunities to earn college credits and vigorous sat prep program job training programs and much much more"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Best school ever my daughter previously went to democracy prep then I switched her to opportunity and she just excelled there they have so many opportunities to earn college credits and vigorous sat prep program job training programs and much much more"},"publishTime":"2019-04-11T00:46:23Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.8031715302915,"longitude":-73.95414211970851},"low":{"latitude":40.8004735697085,"longitude":-73.95684008029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":1,"hour":8,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":16,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":8,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":16,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":8,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":16,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":8,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":16,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":8,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":16,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Saturday: Closed","Sunday: Closed"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"240 W 113th St, New York"}
