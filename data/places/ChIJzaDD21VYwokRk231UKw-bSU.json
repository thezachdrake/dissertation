You may never see your money again!!   My Mother is 89 years old and I am 62.   I am her only child, heir and listed beneficiary in her Will.  My husband passed 16 years ago and we never had children.    I am Mother's legal statutory durable POA.   Mother has a Morgan Stanley IRA & Investment account.   To start the account had approximately $900,000 in it.   Mother and I purchased a new house last year for $300,000 and spent an additional $150,000 in used furniture, grass, fence repair / support, sprinkler system, security system, door locks, etc. things you normally purchase when buying a new home.   We even told the regular Morgan Stanley financial advisor what our plans were, had him wire the purchase price to the title company and told him that 2018 would be an expensive year with more than usual expenditures.    After we purchased the house and about 9 months later, someone with Morgan Stanley called Adult Protective Services and reported that I was financially exploiting my Mother by purchasing the house and making house purchases.  The house was for Mother and I to live in together.   APS was called out.   Female Investigator was young, rude and unprofessional.   She reported many lies to her agency.   2 weeks later a court got involved with 2 Ad Litems, 1 Temp Guardian and a Judge who were very biased and prejudice.   The Judge allowed these attorneys to take my Mother away and spend her money freely.  You talk about FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION.   The attorneys placed Mother in a nursing home.   1 month after being in a nursing home, Mother was admitted by EMS to a hospital for ONE MONTH for severe dehydration and urinary tract infection.   She almost died.  Now I'm in a guardianship case fighting for my Mother.   The Judge, 2 Ad-Litems and Temp Guardian have lied in all pleadings, made slanderous and defaming remarks about me, all the while running up attorney fees at $11,000 per month.   These attorney fees do not include the care for my Mother which is an additional $8,000 per month.   It's an attorney \"feeding freenzy\".  No one can believe it, including other attorneys.    This court group seem corrupt because they all know each other and may be giving each other money \"under the table\".   Of course they are trying to become the permanent guardian so they can continue getting their $11,000 attorney fees.  I've never seen anything like it!!   Then the Temp Guardian sued me for the house, wanting it back to sell it and have more money to take.    Now my Mother's Morgan Stanley account is being depleted.  It won't be long she will be out of money.   The Temp Guardian has used approximately one hundred thousand dollars already, at $20,000 per month within 5 months, excluding the month long hospital bill.
