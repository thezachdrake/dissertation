One interesting fact was that apartments on the higher floors were less expensive than those on the lower floors, which is completely opposite today, where apartments on the higher floors are much more expensive.

Also, everyone generally shared the same water because they didn't want to schlep the water multiple times.\n\nWe went into the Tenement Museum, which was interesting.

In retrospect  this was a mistake because they weighed about 12 pounds and we had to carry them.\n\nThe tour was about 2 hours or so.
