I was provided with a portal usage but wasn't given much guidance on how to find  the info I needed. They are located in both NY and Connecticut but I didn't have the option to do a virtual visit in Connecticut or in person in Connecticut for insurance reasons. I went for a 60-minute virtual initial visit which the amount of time wasn't necessary so patients should have had the option to select the amount of time and amount they are comfortable in paying. Later, I ordered the test kit. It arrived at a timely matter but I didn't get full communication so then I needed to retest part of it. That means they needed to redeliver a test kit. There was no apology on their end with any mistakes made. The lab review appointment was brought up to me which seemed unnecessary as guidance was already provided by the lab so I declined it. Months later, I was provided a new set of pricing and the current patient would need to pay the new pricing despite not completing the process yet.\n\nAfter I already made the visit, I found out they don't provide receipts for out-of-network claims.

Genuine doctors usually examine results without upfront payment. Notably, my test results showed red flags. When I sought a retest for progress, they suggested a 15-minute session, initially appearing complimentary, but an unexpected bill arrived in my inbox later.
