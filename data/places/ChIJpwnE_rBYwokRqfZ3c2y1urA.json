After searching high and low I came across the Orb Audio Booster Basic system which is the “un-soundbar” of soundbars. Clear dialog was the highest priority and these speakers do not disappoint. There is a dialog enhancing feature called EZ Voice but I find it’s not really needed as the regular mode already has amazingly clear dialog. Setup took about 20 minutes and is very easy if you have ever hooked up a pair of speakers before. Read the included instructions as it covers almost every common mistake that could be made. In terms of looks these speakers are very stylish yet unobtrusive and should fit with almost any décor.\n\nOther factors that helped me choose the Orb vs. other surround bar systems. The speaker enclosures are made and assembled in the USA. It’s great to see a small company not outsourcing this work overseas. Customer support is fantastic. If you call their number, one of the two owners of the company will call you back. After speaking to them you can tell they care passionately about their product and their customers.\n\nFor those who are interested in the technical details, the booster is essentially a 50W integrated class D amp with optical and mini-plug inputs. The speakers are connected to the booster with the included speaker wire and have a frequency response of 120Hz-18KHz. I added a Yamaha sub-woofer for extra bass which connects to the Booster sub out. A few things to note. The optical input can only accept PCM so any other digital format like Dolby Digital will not work. I connected my old Pioneer plasma via the analog output so I needed a separate RCA to mini-plug cable which I had on hand.\n\nSo if you want great sound and stylish looks look no further. You will be happy with the Orb Audio system."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"When my Polk Surround Bar started failing, I thought I would just replace it with another sound bar.
