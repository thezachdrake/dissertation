Allison Tylek, the Education Director and sometimes teacher in the classroom, is above and beyond in all that she does for the parents and our children. Down to even taking the time and effort to advise, help and encourage us with sleep training. Among other developmental stages in our toddler’s life. Our daughter loves them all so much! WE love them all so much! She literally skips and runs to school because she’s so excited and happy to be there. The facilities are also fantastic! Large open classroom with lots of natural light, an enclosed, safe and private outdoor playground and an onsite indoor playground with climbing walls and ball pits! Amazing all round! I’m just so grateful to all of the wonderful staff there. Happy mama, happy dad and most importantly happy toddler! We will definitely also be continuing to send our daughter here for their after school program once she’s enrolled in 4K. Best preschool ever!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"There aren’t enough words to describe how brilliant this preschool is.
