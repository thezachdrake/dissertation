My recommendation is to reach out for tax planning early in the year to get a tax plan set up that way you know exactly what you are doing by the time the tax season starts. Dimov asked us to do this our first year & that was different from any prior accountant. It was a huge help because we discovered things we did not know about and really helped us get set up to not miss any deductions.
