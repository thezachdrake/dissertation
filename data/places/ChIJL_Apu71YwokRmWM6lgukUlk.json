I also do Botox with Dr Imber , and this for me is a game changer , he makes sure my Botox is natural looking and i still look 10 years younger afterwards , I like to go in every 3 months for this. Another treatment I Love is PRP , i have seen such a difference in my skin after this treatment , as it increases Collagen , which i desperately need. I also suffer from Rosacea so once a year i go for laser treatment at Dr Imber and this really reduces the redness in my face , so this is a very important treatment that i need to have .
