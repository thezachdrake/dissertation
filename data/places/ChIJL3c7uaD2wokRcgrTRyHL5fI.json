She is so warm and made us feel comfortable right away, and she was incredibly organized and responsive throughout the planning process. We also genuinely enjoyed her company on the day, and that allowed us to be ourselves and interact naturally even though we were on camera. Her second shooter, Molly, is also wonderful and friendly, but we hardly saw her - she is a super skilled ninja! So many times we would be enjoying ourselves and totally immersed in the moment, and just barely notice her out of the corner our eye catching all of those special details without intruding at all. The edited product is a beautiful memory that brings us right back to the feeling of the day, and everyone who sees it can’t help tearing up! We only wish we had splurged on a few more hours. I’d encourage anyone to book this team, and to make as much room in your budget as possible to have them with you from beginning to end - it really is the part of the experience that can stay with you forever! Thank you a million times to Alice and Molly!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We could not be more happy with our decision to work with Alice for our July 2021 wedding on Peaks Island in Portland.
