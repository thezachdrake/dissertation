Everything went as smooth as possible without any complications, and Dr. Shay was careful to remove just what he needed and nothing else. He has incredible bedside manner, and I felt a sense of relief as soon as he walked into the room. I simply can’t say enough good things about Dr. Shay! Also, the office visits are as easy as can be, with very friendly and attentive front desk staff, and very short to no wait times. I’ve gone from having the absolute worst fear and crippling anxiety before every gyno visit elsewhere, to feeling super comfortable and confident that I am in good hands. Dr. Shay and his team have really made all the difference for me. If you’re looking for a gynecologist, you’ve found him. 10/10 would and will recommend!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the first review I’ve ever left for anyone or anything in my life, but I have to share.
