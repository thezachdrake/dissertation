They came with sauerkraut and mustard- both of which were fabulous pairings.  The service however was not great. Our server was friendly and helpful. But one of my pet peeves these days is servers not writing things down. Sure- cool party trick if you get everything right. But only about 10% of the time does that happen. We didn't get the fries we ordered and had to ask for water several times. They also disappeared for long periods of time, despite not being super busy.
