It was very clean, the saunas and steam rooms were very hot, several options of temperature too, and great cold plunge.\nIt is no frills, but such a chill, relaxing environment. The food at the restaurant downstairs is incredibleeeee - I would come back just for that!! Seriously.\nEveryone was super nice, respectful and even made a few friends there. Absolutely will be back!"},"publishTime":"2023-12-01T21:37:14Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJw0iarSJawokRYslMIjGxy1o/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMElUdUNREAE","rating":3,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVKkpBD_RMoEOvf-bI6RvU5eMPlviLU4rg3OhqXZf7w5a56=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106517963843295899913/reviews","displayName":"Nikolai Mazurkin"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"They require and insist on some sort of \"security deposit\" of value.
