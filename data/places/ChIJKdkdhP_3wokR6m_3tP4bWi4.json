The garlic/lemongrass chicken wings made for a perfect, flavorful starter with crispy fried garlic/shallots. Kudos to Wan, the friendly and receptive manager and owner! Having ordered their signature beef short rib pho on Door Dash multiple times, I finally visited in person, and it lived up to every expectation. The broth and flavors are simply exceptional. Not to mention the hoisin and hot sauce are handcrafted to be vegan friendly too. I thought that was pretty neat!
