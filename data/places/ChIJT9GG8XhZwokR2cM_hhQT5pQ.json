Greg saw our vision and was able to deliver beyond my wildest dreams. My dad is a steakhouse fanatic so we wanted to replicate that experience in the comfort of our home. We carefully planned the menu, making sure to have all the favorites plus some additions. He arrived about 3 hours prior to dinner time with some parts of the meal prepped (sauces/dressings) while others were prepped right in my sister's kitchen. We provided the space and he created a 5-star meal using whatever we had in the kitchen. His ability to adapt to his surroundings was remarkable. We were able to relax and socialize in the basement while Greg was in the kitchen preparing the meal. Once the meal was complete, he sat us, served the meal and made sure we had everything we needed. He cleared dishes and helped with drinks as well. He even cleaned the kitchen (my sister and I joked that it was more spotless than it was prior to his arrival). His professionalism and passion for cooking came across in the meal he prepared, we were all blown away. This experience exceeded my expectations and I keep finding reasons why I need Chef Greg to cook for us again. Do yourself a favor and hire Chef Greg for your next special occasion."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My dad's 70th birthday was around the corner and we wanted to do something special for this milestone.
