I’m glad I didn’t ordered any food. They need major hygiene check up on their kitchen. The small fryer that looks like it’s been used over 100 yrs with disgusting residue of previous millions of fries still caked in. YUCK! Most of their food is heated up in an air fryer. Trying to keep their food moist, they spray water before it goes into the fryer. Now their hummus container with old dried hummus remains on container all around. Seriously GROSS.
