As skeptical as they were i believe they had the same experience with The Beast wrap and concluded that they were the best wrap they've ever had. As they were awestrucked with the beast wrap, I went i to town on the DireWolf and a  Brothers Grimm Wrap. They had a completely different dough from eachother. And the toppings were different in each. Making them a completely different burst of flavor for each one. I will be going back to Wolfnights they have a permanent customer in me.
