Dr. Yedidia has that old school education that is so precious and rare these days. He is a highly articulate teacher in the way that he is able to pass that on to his students. I would recommend piano students of any level, beginner, intermediate or professional to experience studying with Dr. Ronn Yedidia for themselves.
