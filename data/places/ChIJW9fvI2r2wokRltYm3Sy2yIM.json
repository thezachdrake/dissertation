She made me a comfortable night-guard to help me with my grinding, and even helped me to safely bleach my teeth with fantastic results. I’m sure I’ll still be seeing her until I need dentures one day! LOL. She is gentle yet thorough, and is always a pleasure to be around. Also, the facilities are clean, the equipment is modern / high tech, the waiting room is relaxing, and the practice is literally right across from the subway stop at 125th and Broadway.
