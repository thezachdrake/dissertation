Horrible.  The client floors , rooms, and bathrooms did not get cleaned unless clients did it themselves and to do that you might be handed a tiny cup of cleaner that you had to rush to pour out before it melted the cup , and a paper towel... To clean 2 bathroom stalls, 3 showers and mop the floor behind 15 women( per floor) most of the time there was garbage, feces, urine, and blood ( menstrual) on the toilets and floors .    I got extremely ill trying to keep the both rooms clean and had to stop .   They didn't provide drinks with meals ...no water fountain, they had one water cooler for over 90 women that was empty for weeks on end .   If you had no money you took your chances with dirty sink faucets or just dehydrated.   Even during heat waves.     It was supposed to be a building for working clients..but good luck getting any sleep between fighting clients , midnight bed checks and staff waiting until 2 am or later to align a new comer to a room.   Most staff were rude , one in particular who enjoyed bullying clients.   Of course you had your problem clients..but this place should be shut down.    I know several ladies who've had to seek mental health counseling after experiencing that shelter.  Conditions in my room were inhumane...radiator pole blew out water ...to keep the room as dry as possible the window had to be cracked ..my bed was next to the window and heater, fan had to be left on and door cracked open.... Winter brought freezing temperatures in that room and you were lucky to wake up dry . Had to wrap my bedding in plastic when I'd leave for work to keep it dry ...woke several times a night to mop the ceiling and walls.    These things were reported many times to 311 and the coalition for the homeless..... Finally after almost 2 years it got fixed.     Horrible, depressing place where it's difficult if not impossible to stay focused on self help and success.    It took over a year to get my voucher and I finally just had to leave for my own sanity and health... Currently couch surfing unable to get anyone to accept this useless voucher.

Also the room sockets did not work. The charger will completely fall out of the wall. On 4/19 at 12am 1/3 of my belongings was packed up my staff Mr. Curtis and put somewhere.
