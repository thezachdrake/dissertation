Definitely a fun & different experience, walking up onto a boat to have some tacos cruising on the Hudson river. It was kind of cloudy for us but it was a nice tolerable weather. Looking through the menu,  They have tequila galore from many regions of Mexico. We chose the region of Chihuahua and we tried la flor del desierto, my tasting note was  smokey with a mild sweet background.  Next time we'll try tequila from the Oaxaca region.\nThe food is quite expensive for the amount of food you receive 2 tacos range between $17 thru $19 , 3 tacos range almost up to $27.  It's a la carte, doesn't come with any sides.\nThe sides range between $5 to $10 .They did have the little crickets called champulines on their side menu, we didn't try those because we wanted to try them authentically in Mexico.\nThe chips and salsa were very expensive for 3 different kinds of salsa, 2 oz of each.\nThey tasted  good but very small amount for $16 ,but be careful because I ordered chips & salsa not chips guac and salsa .... $5 price difference. We ended up ordering 2 tacos each the cochinita pibil and Tony's champenadas  tacos which were the menu's featured taco.  We didn't get any sides because it was just too expensive and not worth it.\nThe 1 hr cruises go  through the northern part of the Hudson, its nice, it's an hour on the dot.  I think my recommendation maybe for this experience  is going on the longer trips,  so you can enjoy more of the ride and specials. For us, it was too quick for a relaxing afternoon.  I do recommend this experience, not the regular food menu, unless you go for the bottomless brunch. But  maybe just the atmosphere with a couple of  drinks  or the bucket of beer was worth it was $36 for 5 beers. We didn't have any dessert there because we were just gonna go elsewhere.  I have a  recommendation to the restaurant:   Offer more food for the price, especially when it's Mexican themed, don't forget customers pay to reserve  a seat on the boat, so complimentary chips is a nice touch maybe for the taco prices add 1 more taco to each. Revise your appetizer menu, or at 4pm do a happy hour.\nBut to us the foodies see what you think, let me know your thoughts, remember enjoy the moment and be safe always.\n#tastebudadventures #restaurantonaboat\n#mexicancuisine #enjoy"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I took my husband to pier 81 La barca cantina in New York City.
