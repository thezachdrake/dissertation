If you have any color or styling issues you have to go to her!\nAfter many years of hair struggles, I gave up. My old stylist moved to Miami years ago and it’s been a never ending struggle of bad styles and color that was off. I felt so down about my hair that I let my roots grow out for 4 months and decided to wear my hair in a ponytail. I thought I just needed a trim of my bangs. So I walked in and met Nadya. She made some suggestions and basically I walked out looking and feeling like a model. A few carefully-placed highlights that blended perfectly into the grey hairs sprouting in my crown, a gentle suggestion to grow out the bangs, a trim on the ends, and I look stunning, if I may say so myself! Nadya said she joined this salon after many years with Jean Pierre Hair Salon (which closed recently). I am so glad I trusted her honest and experienced judgment and excellent vision for what my hair could be! She’s such a lovely person too, I really enjoyed chatting with her and she made me feel like I could trust her with my hair.\nThe price is good for the location and everyone here is so nice. It’s super clean, marble floor, well-lit, and the location is just a few steps from all the major subways, which was so convenient. The environment was very inviting and I will send my friends to this place. If I could give this place a million stars I would. I’m so happy. You  have to check out this place and ask for Nadya.
