I'm not here to bash the church but to explain my experience.  My aunt who was 92 passed away last week. She was a missionary at this church and has been tithing here for over 10 years. Prior to her passing she ended up in a skilled nursing facility. I live in virginia now and her niece lives in Philly. We contacted the church on numerous occasions to see if someone could stop by and pray with her. We spoke with a deacon and the secretary . They informed us someone would give us a call back. No one did. Three weeks later the Lord called her home. My cousin drove in from Philly to make the funeral arraingments and physically stoped by the church to see if we could have her service there. They informed her that the day of her funeral which was 4/27 they said the church had already planned a fish fry for that day. She proceeded to ask would the Pastor then be able to stop by the funeral home and perform her service or even say something quick. We would've worked around his schedule. Once again they said someone would call us. Well sadly to say no one called to say if he was available or even to give condolences. Now for someone to tithe all these years and serve on the board and not be recognized at her home going is awful. Once again  I'm not writing this to bash the church but I do hope this weigh heavy on the people who answered the phone and spoke to my cousin face to face. I'm originally from Brooklyn.  But down here in the south they would've had a member go by and pray with her every Sunday.  Anyone can contact me relating to this . And oh yeah her name Margie Johnson sunset 1/28/1927 sunset 4/18/2019.     I was always taught \"Don't tell God about the storm you going through, but tell the storm about the God you know.\""},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This church has put a bad taste in mouth and has made re think about tithing.
