I felt very confident in his work, and was actually looking forward to working with him. John randomly ended representation without reason, via email, no heads up, no prior conversation or indication of anything being wrong. John also did this 2.5 hours before we were scheduled to meet with the attorney  representing my  former employer. My only guess is that John felt offended that I emailed the morning of this meeting asking for information that should have been provided to me without asking: The time he was meeting with the defendant’s attorney, what strategy we were taking, and if this meeting was to start negotiations. Right after asking these questions, John sent that email ending representation & never cared enough to follow up. Extremely unprofessional and quite rude. Again, I felt good about hiring John initially, so this was very bizarre. It’s almost like he doesn’t want to be questioned. There was a minor situation where John took a statement I said out of context when I was letting him know what my O.B said way before I had reason to sue, and said if I didn’t trust him we didn’t need to work together. That should have been my first red flag, as I felt inclined to address that statement then- or consider the first attorney I spoke to. I found it very offputting that me simply informing him of what I was told before this case, made him feel like I didn’t trust him. We were just having a conversation (or so I thought). I ask necessary and relevant questions. I am very thorough, detailed and like to know what is exactly is going on- maybe John didn’t like that. So, if you’re a client like me who want date/time/ and insight on strategies- maybe look elsewhere for representation. He did the exact same thing my employers did to me, and did not feel the need to explain. Lol very odd and weird\nNot too upset though, I had a lawyer on standby that took the call he dropped & have new representation that I feel confident in.\n\nEDIT: In response to Johns reply, my emails and iMessages aren’t fabricated. Most of your reviews  are from people who spoke with you, but clearly did not work with you. Hardly any of these reviews speak about results. Additionally, I do however agree with most of these reviews that you INITIALLY were very professional. You abruptly ending representation without warrant, after me asking very basic and general questions.
