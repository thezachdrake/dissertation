I mind my business. I’m clean, quiet, and considerate of my neighbors. I don’t really care about things like noise and parties from my neighbors on weekends and holidays as long as things are wrapped up by like 2am. I don’t steal packages or harass anyone, and have never once been late with rent in the 10+ years I’ve rented in NYC.\n\nI will never again in my life rent an apartment run by this company. When I say they’re the worst, I’m really not exaggerating.\n\nFirst when I viewed the apartment before renting, I was deliberately misled. All of the tools and ladders and whatnot used to paint and make modifications after the previous tenant moved out were stuffed in the kitchen so that the state of the kitchen couldn’t really be examined. They also locked the main bathroom so THAT couldn’t be examined either. I was assured that everything would be updated and cleaned by move-in. I accept that I was foolish for believing them, given what I know of the plethora of garbage landlords in this city.\n\nSurprise, surprise after I sign the lease and move in: all kitchen appliances were extremely old, moldy, and otherwise extremely filthy. Oven light doesn’t work, fan is ineffective. The handle to the fridge was taped on. The sink faucet was taped together and leaks freely, leaving more mold. The dishwasher has an extremely foul odor that does not go away no matter what I’ve tried. The bathroom they locked before I signed the lease has no ventilation and so also regularly builds up mold even when I bought a de-humidifier to help manage the problem. The bathtub has filth that can’t be removed with any household cleaner I’ve tried. The tap water occasionally runs brown. Leaks from apartments above happen regularly to the point that there’s yet more mold - a portion of the wall in one bedroom is completely soft (and yes, moldy) because of how regularly water has come down. But lucky me I occasionally get the “landlord special” where the super comes and paints over moldy areas with white paint.\n\nAside from the many problems within the unit, the building itself is shoddily run. Not once since I moved in has the buzzer worked for my apartment. Not only that but they randomly changed the lock to the door of the building without notice and without providing new keys. Also the key fob system used by tenants to enter the building has gone on the fritz multiple times, leaving many of us just locked out. Packages have been stolen from my doorstep MANY times. Neighbors are extremely inconsiderate with respect to things like noise control and proper disposal of trash. Calling the mgmt company to report anything is a complete and utter waste of time. All that those people are capable of doing is collecting rent apparently, and even then they have issues sometimes. There’s no one you can reach out to via email (presumably so there’s no record of anything they say), and no one provides their last names if you call on the phone. Don’t bother trying to go in-person to talk to anyone at their office either - they’ve used COVID as an excuse to never allow any tenant into their office anymore.\n\nLiving here is such a joke, and I cannot wait to leave. If you have literally any other option, do not live in one of these buildings ever.
