She treated me like family from the first visit.

She has masterfully handled my total care with continuity which was especially critical because it was her referral that saved my life! When I went for my routine colonoscopy they found a very large tumor that was cancer and I ended up with an emergency resection. Now Dr. Chan is overseeing all of my critical labs, pathology, specialist referrals, and total wellness program with efficiency, compassion and my overall life situation in mind. This is a rare combination of genuine talent and God given insights. I trust her with my life! I have also referred my young adult daughter to her who works in NYC and has some delicate health concerns which have been mounting for over five years and only Dr. Chan has seemed to immediately grasp, treat and resolve. I am most grateful to Dr. Chan for being one of the finest physicians I have ever known.
