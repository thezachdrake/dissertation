There really isn't anything on display, so you have to know what you want before you go there.

On my last visit there I paid $77 for a 5lb box of super colossal U10 shrimp and $65 for a 5 lb bag of dry scallops (size 10 to 20). At places like Citarella you will find the price per pound of these to be more than double what they are here.\nAside from the usual issues with buying from a wholesale place in terms of not being pretty, fishy water covering the floor (but reasonably clean, just wet), if you really care about your shellfish and can deal with buying wholesale quantities, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Plus you will be supporting a local small business which has been on this block for over 30 years (I know this because I've been buying shellfish from them for pretty much that long. That statement in and of itself should convince you, and if that doesn't know that a lot of the best restaurants in Manhattan also get their shellfish here)."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"They recently relocated 1 block East and you have to look closely to find it because there is no signage and it's in a basement.
