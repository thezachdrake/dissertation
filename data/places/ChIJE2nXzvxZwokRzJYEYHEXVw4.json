While my egg freezing attempt here was unsuccessful, the most disappointing part was being treated as a number rather than a person. The NYU Langone fertility centre is generally a factory given the number of patients they have, but Dr Devore took it a step further by going on holiday mid treatment, without informing me. I only found out when I said ‘see you on Monday’ (day of my retrieval), and only then did she inform me that she was on holiday and another doctor would be performing my retrieval. She also failed to listen to my concerns about the  trigger shot (as I had a previous unsuccessful retrieval at another facility). This led to another unsuccessful retrieval. Instead of discussing with me options, she only said there could be a variety of factors and suggested I don’t go through another attempt as it could lead to another failure. She basically gave me no hope and did not take it as a challenge to try and find a solution, even when I shared articles about cases like mine to show that several things could be done to improve outcomes. Several months later, I have had a successful experience at a smaller facility where the Dr and entire team were 100% dedicated to my journey: the new Dr took me through the possible reasons for my two unsuccessful attempts, followed my natural cycle to learn how my body works, and the Dr gave a protocol that worked! So my advice to any patients who  have specific fertility concerns or diagnosis, or who expect a Dr that will fully be dedicated to your personal journey, is to find another doctor. I wish I had known this and saved myself thousands of dollars."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"If you want a dedicated doctor who will closely follow your treatment and journey, Dr Devore is unfortunately not it.
