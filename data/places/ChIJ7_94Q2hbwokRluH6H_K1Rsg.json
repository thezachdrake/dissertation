Hava blended them beautifully. She managed to deliver on my need for functionality and storage, my 15 year old’s desire for a more sophisticated room reflecting her more mature style, and my 10-year old”s pink princess look. Not an easy task! She managed to create separate spaces that are still cohesive and elegant. The big work and items made a stunning impact, but the small design touches really took it over the top. Although my task of decluttering was monumental and time-consuming, once the room was prepped, the painting and installation went smoothly and quickly.
