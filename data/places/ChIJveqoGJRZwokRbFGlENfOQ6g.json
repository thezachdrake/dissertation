He claimed we didnt have an apointment. And we had to leave because he was tired and we should come back the next day at 11 am.  The next day he messaged that 2 pm would be better for him. I told him that we could not continue using his service and that he could keep $600 for his time and return  $2000, which he refused.  After haggling he returned $1000 and said he would give us any documents of ours he had at 2pm but then texted again that we could pick them up at a cleaners across for his apartment on Waverley Place.\nThe document he returned was only a handwritten letter I had written detailing why the young man was late in filing for asylum which was on Mr Joseph's recommendation and was not even correct.\nIn summation, Mr Joseph who is currently undergoing chemotherapy, fraudulently represented himself as an experienced immigration lawyer, padded the hours he spent doing \"research\" etc. and created a situation where not only are we over the time limit for filing  for asylum, and he has put the young man in question in danger of being rejected for his asylum application, but we have now to pay another lawyer to undo his negligence.\nI have written proof of\nall of this and am now seeking the return of $1600 of his retainer.\nMy recommendation is to stay away from Peter A Joseph Esquire.  As per my recent experience,  he is a total fraud and a very poor lawyer with serious memory issues."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I went to Peter Joseph office early January to file for asylum fora young man who was seeking asylum.
