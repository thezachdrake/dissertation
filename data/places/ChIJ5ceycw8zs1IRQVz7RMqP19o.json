This was the moment I knew I couldn’t afford to NOT invest in myself and I signed up for Anastasia’s Group Find Your Life’s Work Coaching program. Through this program and Anastasia’s unprecedented coaching skills, I found the clarity I’d been searching for! Thanks to her, I have the confidence and tools to start my own business as I work toward becoming a meditation and visualization instructor to help others who face chronic pain, like me, find relief and live fulfilling lives! Without Anastasia’s program and coaching, I wouldn’t have dared to dream of a life and career where I could make a difference and still take care of myself. I am eternally grateful for Anastasia’s guidance and support.
