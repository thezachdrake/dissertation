And she’s helping me take steps toward actually getting better, not just covering over symptoms with medications. It’s hard. All of this is hard. What makes it doable is that on appointment day, Linda is there and focused on helping me. And the support staff at SohoMD are responsive and easy to contact. I sent them a message at the beginning of typing this review asking them what month I had my first appointment with Linda because I didn’t remember. They have already answered me back. It’s comforting knowing that the people who are there to help me are actually…there. I highly recommend SohoMD and Linda."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"In January 2023 I knew I needed some mental health help.
