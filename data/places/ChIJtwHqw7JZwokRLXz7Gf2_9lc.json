You can feel the good vibe in this place. Now to the job: laminating as you may know has a few ordering details: thickness, finish quality, edge (\"lip\"), etc. They quickly explained the needed details, I went off to make the necessary new copies, brought them back, and easily submitted the job order. Aladdin's a printer for the corporate big large print run types but they were able to accommodate our relatively very small order of 22 pages at a price $1.81 or 40% less than Staples (4min walk away @ 500 8th Av for $3.39/pg) or ABC Imaging (3min walk away @ 336 W 37th S for $3.49/pg).
