The hot sour soup came very dense and rich of contents and a lot of flavor and I like it very much. The pork fried rice was well done too, minced bbq pork mixed well with turmeric colored yellow rice, very loose not sticky, and tasty. Mushroom chicken had mushroom and snow peas, carrots and other veggies which was just what I savored for. A Korean client told me the owner was from Malaysia.
