We have found her to be roundly and thoroughly experienced, fully informed and up-to-date about both medical and alternative methods and, perhaps most importantly, intuitive in her ability to apply them.\n\nHer years of experience working with racehorses emphasized her orthopedic experience and she is an excellent diagnostician, knows just how to treat things and has developed rehab protocols that have healed and supported our dogs' progress with more thorough attention than any physical therapist for humans we have ever run across.  Our family adopts rescue dogs, and it seems that there was often some kind of physical trauma in their early lives. As a result of our dogs' misaligned, scar tissue laden and previously injured bodies, over the years, they experienced sore or injured shoulders, spines, torn ACLs,  strained deep digital flexor tendons, pulled groin muscles.  Dr. Gladstein was able to diagnose the problems, when sometimes other vets could not, and heal them with her carefully conceived, noninvasive protocols.\n\nFor those of you who are interested in her use of prolotherapy for orthopedic injuries, I originally discovered Dr. Gladstein because I had used prolotherapy on my knees some years back. This is not an alternative methodology, simply a medical one that fell out of use once surgery came into play. I had severe cartilage issues with my knees and prolotherapy healed them permanently. It is a wonderful healing technique and Dr. Gladstein has educated herself extremely well in its use. I highly recommend you check for the literature that is either posted on her website or online. The articles in The Prolotherapy Journal are fascinating and informative. Once you read them, you may never want to consider orthopedic surgery again for your pet or yourself!\n\nShe is also completely versed in all other areas of veterinary care,  providing us with annual check ups, vaccinations, worm prevention, any digestive issues that arise, wound care -  any and everything that our dogs have come up with! For those who do not care to work with alternative methods, Dr. Gladstein has every medical tool available. We, in our family, do believe in supplementing medical care with alternative methods, so it has been a godsend to find a fully certified veterinarian who knows how and when to use and blend non-surgical techniques, acupuncture, chiropractic adjustment, alternative supplements instead of, or in conjunction with, medicine and nutrition.\n\nOn a more personal note, Babette has made herself available to us like no other vet.  On the occasion that our dog was violently vomiting at ten at night, she didn't put us off by sending us off to an emergency vet center to spend the night there. Instead, after learning what the dog had ingested and determining its lack of acute danger, she coached us through how to care for our dog at home and made herself available by phone throughout the night.  This did involve us calling her back twice more that night, the last time being at 2 AM, and at the end of each phone call she made sure to tell us to call again if we had any other worries or questions.  She checked in with us first thing in the morning, before we even had a chance to call to tell her that everything was fine. It is also notable that, while a visit to veterinary offices were always quite brief, a veterinary appointment with Babette will see her spending as much time as your pet could need. When she comes to do a rehab session, she spends up to two hours with one of our dogs, making sure that he gets every care possible.\n\nBabette is consistently dedicated, caring and with the best interests of our pets at the forefront. I have had horses, cats and dogs all my life, and I have never, ever felt so secure that we humans will have the best guidance and that our pets will have the best care and support from our association with Babette."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr. Gladstein has cared for our dogs for many years now.
