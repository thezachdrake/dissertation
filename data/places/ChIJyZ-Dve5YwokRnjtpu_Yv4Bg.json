The doctor put me on a regiment of Benadryl and corticosteroids.  Nothing worked.  I went through about 7 doctors and a bunch of treatments.  I got diagnosed with Lupus, Vasculitis, others told me Leukemia and a bunch of other diseases My 8th doctor was Doctor Blum Rheumatologist  at Columbia.  After he examined me he recommended Dr. Grossman.  I really believe that if it was not for Doctor Grossman I would still be running around trying to find out what I have.  Although we never found out the cause Dr. Grossman saved my life and sanity by trying methods to help me.  It took him 6 weeks to do what others did not in 2 years of hives.  The hives went away and I only had one flare up after that.  Doctor Grossman is the best dermatologist in NY.
