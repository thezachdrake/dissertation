From what I heard she was a doctor, she walked in demanded to be seen immediately by the eye doctor not taking in consideration of others waiting, basically to skip everyone.  The staff there complied because of all the disruption she was causing, but she was extremely rude towards “Gigi” because she is the one that assisted her after the doctor had checked her.  She felt entitled because she was a doctor who works in the hospital and therefore can be extremely rude to others, I can't imagine how she treats all the other working staff in the hospital who is below her, sad that a doctor who is supposed to save lives doesn't have respect or compassion for others.  I wanted to put this review to let you know what a great staff you have working here, from the doctor, to Gigi and Liz, but most importantly so that you are aware of what they go thru and the abuse that they endure by “their own peers” from the field, but someone should report this to the Hospital’s HR department, how their hired employees and perhaps even on the clock show a behavior that is of concern as they don’t represent their ethics and values of compassion, dignity and respect to everyone."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was there yesterday trying to pick up my glasses, Gigi was very nice and helpful, she measured my frame and adjusted them to make sure it was to my satisfaction.

Sure enough, the eyewear company was kind enough to replace the glasses with the current prescription I received from Dr. Jacobson.  Liz went above and beyond to help me realizing that a huge error was committed by a previous Dr. and understanding that I could not spend so much more money on new lenses and glasses after only a couple of months.
