I'm a huge fan of cocktail bars of all types and I was hoping that this could end up being a fun new local place. Unfortunately, I would categorize their opening as \"rocky at best\".\n\nAmbiance:\nArguably one of the areas where Wallace performed best. The ambiance was quite nice (as can be seen in the pictures), dark wood accented with gold as one might generally expect from an upscale piano lounge. The pianoist and singer were talented and set a relaxed tone for the entire experience.\n\nService:\nWhile everyone was perfectly kind, it was felt obvious that the place was new. At a few points, servers forgot which liquors were offered by the bar as well as the price of various liquors. If you only offer ~5 signature cocktails on the menu, I expect you to be able to offer any and all classic cocktails. Additionally, I expect a cocktail/libations-focused piano lounge to offer a wider variety of spirits that what is available here.\n\nDrinks/Food:\nWe all only got 1 drink each and didn't end up ordering food so I can't speak to the food. I can say that they offered free rice chips which were absolutely drowned in oil (I felt bloated after eating only 1). I got the Martinez signature cocktail and my wife got a dirty martini. The upside here is that both drinks were excellently made and well-balanced. The dirty martini was exactly what my wife wanted and the Martinez was a fun cherry-tinged twist on a classic gin martini.\n\nPricing:\nThe food is certainly a bit on the pricier side. In terms of drinks, ~$20 for what was effectively a modified gin martini is a little bit ridiculous. That's normally what I would expect to pay for a very interesting and unique craft cocktail. However, if you're the only upscale piano lounge in the area, I guess you can get away with charging those prices.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience, as evidenced by my 3-star review. It certainly wasn't bad enough to warrant a 2-star experience (especially considering how new the place is) but is not anywhere near impressive enough to warrant a 4-star experience. As a starting point, I'd recommend building out the spirit selection and craft cocktail selection, espcially if they want to be competitive with the vibrant cocktail scene offered by NYC."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"11 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I want to preface this review by stating that the Wallace Lounge has only been open for ~10 days at the time of my writing of this review.\n\nWith that said, I (as an Upper West Side resident) was very excited to see a new upscale piano lounge opening on the UWS.
