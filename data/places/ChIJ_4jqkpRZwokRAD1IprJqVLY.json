I bought a very expensive shirt from them with buttons that were riveted on rather than sowed. One of the buttons came apart after only wearing the shirt 4 or 5 times and 2 visits to the dry cleaners. Riveted buttons should never come apart unless vigorously mistreated. I asked customer service if it was possible for them to send it out to have a new button riveted on, which I would have been happy to pay for. They responded, sadly they don’t believe the button could be repaired, but if I could find someone who could do so they would reimburse me for the repair even though in the same statement they fully admitted it couldn’t be done. Really?! Why bother offering? Then I asked them if they could send me a new button assembly so I could attempt to have the repair done properly. They said we don’t supply spare parts for our clothes. Again, really?! The reason you don’t supply spare parts is because you’re over confident they won’t ever be needed. I wish that were the case, but maybe it’s time for you to come down off your high horse and get a grip on the reality that your products are overpriced and cheaply made. I relayed to the customer service representative how disappointed I was with their attempt to make me whole again. All he had to say afterwards was he understood my frustration and he hoped I can get it repaired eventually. Huh? The least he could have done was offer me a discount on a new shirt within the same price range. I’ll never buy Billy’s products again unless customer service becomes what it should be. A word of advice Billy Reid, poor customer service is a virus. I would have continued to spend a ton of money in your store if it wasn’t for the treatment I just received."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Billy Reid’s customer service stinks!
