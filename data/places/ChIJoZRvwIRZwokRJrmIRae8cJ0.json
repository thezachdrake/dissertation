I had the unfortunate need to use Manhattan Jewish Funeral Home two times over the past few years and continue to be impressed with the overwhelming courtesy, concern and professionalism from the staff who worked alongside Colonial Funeral Home in Staten Island. Fran, the liaison from Manhattan Jewish, helped me with paperwork on more than several occasions and informed me about services I would never have known about if it weren’t for her.  Tom, from Colonial, helped arrange for the funeral, flight of my sister from Florida to NY, and acted as an intermediary between the Florida funeral home for me. Tom was beyond kind when I had to make arrangements and was a true Knight in Shining Armor at the cemetery. My first experience at Colonial was in 2019 with Michael, and he was a Godsend in an otherwise nightmare. In fact, all of the staff at Manhattan Jewish and Colonial Funeral Home are consummate professionals who have helped me through the most difficult times I ever had to endure.
