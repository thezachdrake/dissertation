We were told that stand by tickets 1 through 10 usually get in. When we came back at three we got shuffled into lines according to our stand by ticket order. By 4pm they announced which tickets got in and sure enough 1-8 were accepted right away!\n\nThe experience was super fun! Extremely well organized! If you go to stand by be there 5:30am to be sure to get in. You can’t sit while waiting so wear comfy shoes. There is a Starbucks right downstairs and a bathroom at the other end of the building. At ten they let you in the store and hand out the tickets. Then you can go back to the hotel to nap ;) or just enjoy the town until 3pm when you need to be back. Your ticket number matters at 3pm, so don’t be discouraged if a long line has formed already. They take you in order of the ticket number. Don’t bring big bags or big school bags. You have to be on time.\nThe peacock lounge upstairs for waiting is super nice and has a water fountain and bathroom. Once you get into the show you cannot leave until it’s done taping. It takes about 1.5hrs so you are out about 6:30!
