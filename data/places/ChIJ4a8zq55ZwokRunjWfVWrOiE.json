He is a laid back guy, soft spoken and straightforward. He went on the roof and a few minutes later, came back with an estimate. Doing our due diligence, we got other estimates, one which was TWICE the amount and the other was quite a bit higher than Willmott. The thing is, neither of those guys looked like they ever picked up a hammer. They didn't inspect the roof, they didn't go on the roof. How are you supposed to know what shape a roof is in without going up there? They were just salesmen. Sometimes the lowest estimate doesn't work out, but  going with my gut, I knew Wilson was a man of his word. He didn't disappoint - the roof came out beautiful. Eleven men showed up exactly at the time they were supposed to and got right to work. They shielded all our plantings with drop cloths, moved our backyard furniture and then moved it back when they were done. They left the grounds immaculate.
