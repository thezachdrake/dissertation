Funny enough, one of the people we were with said he hates this place cause he’s gotten yelled at by a bartender before for celebrating a win in pool. If you are a young male aged 22-26, don’t come here cause the pathetic bartenders will feel intimidated by you and hate you immediately. Don’t care if you’re busy and having a bad night, no excuse to talk to me that way. Also worth noting that they will continuously be very polite to any young girl, and serve them constantly. The bartenders are clearly on a power trip since this spot is small and local, and they think that they get to play up the “local bar that’s gritty” trope or whatever. Also hilarious how there’s so many reviews on here saying the exact same thing.
