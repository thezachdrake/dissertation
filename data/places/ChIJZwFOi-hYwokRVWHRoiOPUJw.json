My experience here was good for regular check ups and cleaning, but really bad for whitening. Even though my appointment was to see a dentist before the procedure, that did not happen. A nurse did the whole process alone. I told her I have sensitive teeth, but she didn't recommend the at-home treatment which looking back would have been better for me. Next day my lips started to get red and swollen. The dentist whom I was supposed to see agreed to see me. He said it could have been allergic reaction from vitamin E, or something that I did, for example, touching something on the subway and touching my lips. Neither is the case. On the second day, my lips got worse. It lookee like I had hundreds little herpes on my lip lines. It hurt so much. It hurt to smile, drink water not to mention to eat. They would rip and ooze yellow puss. I went to see the dentist again next day. His only explanation was \"I've never seen this reaction before\". They did not bring the nurse who treated me to speak to me. No matter what exactly caused it, I was certain it was the whitening. And the dentist showed no empathy. He even accused me of making things worse by touching my lips. There was no apology. There was no admission of any wrongdoing. There was no refund to make things right.\n\nTo conclude, I would not recommend New York Dental Office for teeth whitening. After all that, my teeth came back to their original color at the end of that week. I was careful about eating only white food. It took over a week to recover. The business representative of the office contacted me to try to make things right, but no refund was offered and they eventually stopped contacting me.
