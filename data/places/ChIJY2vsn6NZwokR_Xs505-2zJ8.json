At first I thought my new husband was crazy when he told me the cost - but here we are now, 22 years later, our boys nearly grown, 1 a college sophomore the other a H.S. Junior.

Just kidding- but seriously, I give this company my highest rating, so I guess that’s  5 Stars- & TOTALLY WORTH THE INVESTMENT! It’s never sagged or drooped or bunched up - got misshaped, honestly, none of those things has ever happened nor do I fear it happening.\n\nTo Duxiana & all your employees, I sincerely hope you enjoy working for a company that makes such a quality product!
