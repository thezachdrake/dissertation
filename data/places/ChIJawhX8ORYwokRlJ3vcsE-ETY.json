I must've looked at her as if she had two heads, and then I remembered my initial outreach to Shelby for immediate help.  Bottom line, we have done so much amazing work with Doug that I totally forgot the reason we signed up with Doug for fast track. Shelby and Doug understood the urgency I\nin training her during her imprint period to set her up for success.  I am blessed for Shelby training my last dog, Scout (Rip) as a puppy (and me as a first time owner).  Scout  had a great life with her training foundation, and this time around is even better. Not only is Doug an amazing trainer, he has become like family.. I cannot wait to train with him for Good Citizen, and for Roo to become a therapy dog.
