I have called the police several times to my place of work for help to which they always go above and beyond. These same officers even come back to see me and to receive medical care. Even in my own personal life I have had nothing but pleasant interactions with officers, so much so that I have left them treats to show my gratitude. However today I decided to call the precinct to ask for some advice regarding a current situation I was dealing with. PA Gibbs who is not a police officer answered the non-emergency line and was very nasty. She rushed me as I was trying to explain and gave me the NASTIEST energy I have ever received when dealing with the 23rd Precinct. She even yelled at me on the phone and told me to stop speaking. That is beyond unprofessional. After that I asked PA Gibbs if she can transfer me to someone else because I didn't feel as if she was being helpful. She forgets to put me on hold so I hear speaking to her collogues about me. Her tone was absolutely unacceptable. If you are going to say bad things the least you can do is put me on hold so I don't hear you. I was then transferred to Sergeant Paulo who was fantastic. He gave me such great advice without any type of attitude. I wish I could leave 5 stars however PA Gibbs was one of the WORST human interactions I have ever had. No one with that attitude should be working in ANY type of environment that deals with people let alone at a precinct where civilians go to and call for help. Absolutely ridiculous. Thank you to all of the officers that make a difference every day and never hesitate to help. You are all amazing and I thank you for your service."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have lived in East Harlem my entire life and have never really had any bad interactions with any of the officers from the 23rd Precinct.
