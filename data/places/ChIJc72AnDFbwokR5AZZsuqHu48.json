For over 15 years I had a career in Professional Ballroom and Latin Dance but I was exhausted and the things I thought will make me happy and all the achievements I had - didn’t really fulfill me.\n\nSo 2 months after the painting night I went to Detox Retreat in Poconos and I was amazed with the all information and knowledge I received there from Grand Master Teacher & Founder Alaknanda Nabar and all the support as well as guidance from Master Teacher Kate Chmil. I came back to my life after the retreat with new energy, new ideas and inspiration. I stared to use essential oils and do mediations daily. Although I had tried lots of mediation techniques before coming to the center but when I stated to come to the center for Alaknanda’s Timeline Healing Meditations and different center events I had incredible changes in my emotional state. I also got my Usui Reiki Level 1 & 2 Attunement and Initiation from Alaknanda which helped me in my personal healing journey.\n\nA few more months later I visited Reiki Retreat to learn advanced and deeper healing practices which completely changed my perspective in life and I slowly stared to come back to my real self. I have to say working on yourself and bringing yourself on your High Karmic Path and staying there is not easy. It requires a lot of dedication, strength, faith and honesty with yourself & with your teacher, as well as strong principles and morales, it’s definitely is not a path for everyone. But this is exactly what I was looking for: Real Vedic knowledge, complete integrity and unconditional support- that’s what I found in the center and that’s what helped me to be where I am right now!\n\nAfter the Reiki retreat I got my Karmic Life Map from Alaknanda and she guided me to go for a yoga certification based on my chart as well as my experience with Physical Body. I was practicing yoga for more then 6 years before but never thought of becoming a yoga teacher. But when I went through my Yoga certification in Integral Yoga Institute I understood that I would love to share all the knowledge and experience I got through my life. When Alaknanda and Kate offered me to teach Yoga based on traditional Vedic Knowledge at the Center- I was ecstatic to get such an opportunity to work with such amazing people and to pursue my life purpose.\n\nI spent the next few months doing daily intense trainings that lasted 10-15 hours with Alaknanda and Kate learning about the energetic aspects of yoga and physical body that was not covered by my Yoga Teacher Training. In a few months I was teaching yoga in another Reiki Retreat for Energy Academy students.\n\nI am forever grateful to Alaknanda for Founding the Family of Light Holistic Center and to Kate for supporting the Mission. This center had changed my life completely, brought purpose to my being on this planet and connected me to my mission of supporting people to get in and stay on their High Karmic Path, where they can be happy, fulfilled, balanced and aligned with their Higher Self, where they can find their purpose and mission, their soul families and soulmates, build supportive families, grow and expand as human beings.\n\nI highly recommend everyone to try all services that the center offers and then see how your life becomes amazing."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Words can’t describe how much I’m grateful for Family of Light Holistic Center and my Grand Master-Teacher Alaknanda Nabar, who is the founder and co-owner of the center.\nI came to the center in February 2018 for the Intuitive Painting Night by just pure “coincidence”, I didn’t know how drastically my life will change in less than 1 year after I entered the center.\n\nWhen I came to center I was physically and emotionally exhausted, in a beginning stage of depression, didn’t know what to do and where to move in my life.

When Alaknanda and Kate offered me to teach Yoga based on traditional Vedic Knowledge at the Center- I was ecstatic to get such an opportunity to work with such amazing people and to pursue my life purpose.\n\nI spent the next few months doing daily intense trainings that lasted 10-15 hours with Alaknanda and Kate learning about the energetic aspects of yoga and physical body that was not covered by my Yoga Teacher Training. In a few months I was teaching yoga in another Reiki Retreat for Energy Academy students.\n\nI am forever grateful to Alaknanda for Founding the Family of Light Holistic Center and to Kate for supporting the Mission. This center had changed my life completely, brought purpose to my being on this planet and connected me to my mission of supporting people to get in and stay on their High Karmic Path, where they can be happy, fulfilled, balanced and aligned with their Higher Self, where they can find their purpose and mission, their soul families and soulmates, build supportive families, grow and expand as human beings.\n\nI highly recommend everyone to try all services that the center offers and then see how your life becomes amazing."},"publishTime":"2019-05-10T04:09:48Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.714617180291505,"longitude":-74.01199171970849},"low":{"latitude":40.711919219708506,"longitude":-74.01468968029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":9,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":20,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":9,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":20,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":9,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":20,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":9,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":20,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":9,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":20,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":9,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":20,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":9,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":20,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Tuesday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Wednesday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Thursday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Friday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Saturday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Sunday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"World Trade Center, One, Fulton St Suite 8500, New York"}
