Forgot to take a picture of the pistachio raspberry, but the appearances and aesthetics of everything were amazing! The flavor wasn’t…the hot chocolate was mediocre and definitely was not worth the price. It was $8, and it was smaller than a tall drink from Starbucks. I may have had like 5 sips total. However, the taste of the pistachio raspberry was better than the hot chocolate. As least I can see why it was $10. Really wish I could have taken a photo, but Bryant Park Winter Village was busyyyy and packed so I couldn’t. Overall, get their whoopie pies instead of the hot chocolate if you’re okay with spending more than normal for a whoopie pie! Don’t get me wrong, the drink was beautifully done, but it’s not all that. I would rate the hot chocolate 2 out of 5 stars, and the whoopie pie 4 out of 5 stars so that’s why my overall rating is 3 out of 5 stars. At least the pies are also pretty and taste good!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Ordered cookies and cream hot chocolate and a pistachio raspberry whoopie pie.
