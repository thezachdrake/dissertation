In fact on multiple occasions I tried to get my rent lowered in light of the global pandemic and their leadership would ignore my emails. The last thing is the staff is wildly unprofessional, one woman named Susan was the worst. She would intentionally ignore emails, not respond, and go silent. Didn’t matter how many times you reached out. One time I actually had a neighbor down the street see me leave my building and she came up and asked about my experience there. I was open and honest and she said, “that makes sense, I notice they always have empty apartments available.” I’m sure there are some positive people who work at Marbrose but sadly my experience was very upsetting and not the best."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’m sad to say my experience with Marbrose and their management was the worst I’ve experienced in NYC.
