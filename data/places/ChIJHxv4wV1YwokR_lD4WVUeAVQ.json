They recently renewed the carpet, and the hotel-like hallway looks even more luxurious. This apartment has an 18-inch deep bathtub, which was a must for me. Good location, but it takes about a 10-15 mins walk to the closest subway station. Several grocery stores nearby, and walking/running along the Hudson River park is always nice. The gym is fabulous and has everything you need. No rooftop, just a courtyard. What I liked the most was the overall peaceful residential environment.
