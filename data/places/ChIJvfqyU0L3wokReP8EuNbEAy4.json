Dr. Lee made my visit comfortable and was very detailed when discussing my dental health. Not only was the visit pleasant, but Dr. Lee took the initiative to email me a recap of what was discussed and touched base with me a few hours after the visit to check-in if I was experiencing any discomfort or pain from my visit. I greatly appreciate this experience, most doctors won’t take this initiative they would wait until the patient contacts them with a problem or a concern.
