Once you get a set schedule. When your a floater in the beginning I would be sent to a site and then a guard would be there for the shift.

So I learned to shut off my phone on my days off. What I will say is if your a student they will work around your schedule. If they make you work overtime they just happen to pay you for it because they “forgot” and will either pay you from the safe. This is what they did but once but refused to give me the time and a half I was entitled to. Another tactic they use is saying oh I’ll put it on your next check, then will tell you to take one day off so on paper you only have 40 hours so they get out of paying you time and a half. Don’t let me get started on the fake union they have where they take money out your check every week, but claim you don’t get benefits for two years. Knowing damn well nobody’s gonna last two years. A union but not one sign in the office about i thats a lil suspect. And when I confronted the owner he suspended me for a week. It’s been years since I worked there it may have changed for the better. And I never got my last check from them either!!!!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Was a ok job. Once you get a set schedule.
