I did the hybrid program so I participated in Zoom lectures on all the material, followed up by a month and a half of in person skills. Firstly, Sean is the main instructor who runs the lectures and he is amazing. He explains everything in full and always stops when someone has a question or just stops and asks if anyone has any questions. Sean provides you with a schedule on the first day that outlines everything in the course and I can tell you from personal experience that seeing the schedule really helped me a lot in time management and getting everything I needed to get done. Second, the in person skills were amazing. I was out of Ronkonkoma and the instructors there (Rick, Felix, Matt, and Steven) were very helpful and knowledgeable about the skills. The best part about the skills besides the instructors was the size of the class. My class had only 8 people and I heard that previous classes had about 12 or 15. The small size is because the school is spread throughout the state. However, because of the small class size, the instructors could have more 1 on 1 time and explain everything in depth. It's not like a big city program with almost 100 students and 2 instructors. Trying to learn in that environment is a lot harder than in Aura Prep. Lastly, Aura Prep is very good at responding to emails. Anytime I had a question either about the program, material, or something random Sean or whoever I was emailing would get back to me fast and with all my questions answered. This is a very efficient, effective, and affordable course and I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to become an EMT."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the best Suffolk County/ New York State EMT program out there.
