I was let go due to a mistaken words under deep stress and pressure of a 2 hour heavy line and rude and nasty customers and I do not think the manager liked me much. I spent 7 years in the company and after the lost of a dear friend Fausto who I came up in the company with me for 5 years at this store, It hurt not to be there at the store when it happened to show my condolence. I can say that this company does not care about the workers like that all the time, only the reviews matter. Starbucks lost it's soul years ago and many workers made it harder to feel welcomed. I suffer from Schizophrenia, Depression and Anxiety disease and it was a hard road to get better and stronger but it was too much to work here. Especially after all I went through in life. It felt forced and forced smiles and nasty attitudes from customers too. I care about my former customers because I do believe they deserved better as people. Knew many by name and drink. People searched for me to help them. I cared about people even when I felt hurt and after being let go due to me saying I wanted to blow my brains out because the customers were too much, I was unaware of what I was saying since I was so tired that day. Tried to play it off but worked those 2 weeks with renew vigor and said I will not give up on my people. Next thing I know it, people were talking, manager hears this and writes it like I wanted to hurt everyone which is not true at all. I appealed to this company only to be given the cold shoulder. I forgive the manager since she probably didn't know they would do this to me however how she wrote it was wrong on her part and should have been thought out or at least someone speak to me properly. I was given Separation from the company with no chance for rehire. Who cares right? Work is work yet not always. Sometimes when you pour your heart and soul into something, that feeling when broken hurts a lot. I know I would never dare hurt those I care about, especially those I served since my life was still healing from abuse from the streets and homelessness. I thought this company was different and cared about me but instead, let me go on Christmas and I had to survive with what little I had once more. Almost lost my place and more but kept fighting on. Found a job in the same area which feels challenging yet better than how this company treated me.\n\nWhat I can say is this, I do miss this spot dearly yet I will never agree with the ruling they made and always speak my mind to those that need to hear it. This company can do better and I wish I could be unbanned and heard at least yet I am glad I do not work in this company anymore. The people both in the company and the customers deserve better. No one is a robot or product to buy off. Customers are still people. Workers who give it their all and work hard in this company deserve better. I did not deserve how I was let go and treated. I miss my people's and it probably doesn't matter what I say here yet I want to say this: As much as it hurts to never see those I served, I am glad I served them and did my best. Too much had happened in those months. I cried and got mad but in the end, I kept on smiling for those who needed it. That is something I will never regret doing. I am far from perfect but people need to learn to care about each other and be kinder. People deserve to be given better chances, even when mistakes occur. Everyone makes mistakes and this store does try its best to make things right but maybe things have changed. I will never know. I thought I would leave with my head held high and maybe get a cake as a goodbye but instead was thrown away without a chance. I know one day if I ever own a company or become a manager, People will be treated right and given a better chance because the alternative is terrible to live in. Trust me, life can be hard and cruel. I forgive the manager to a degree and the company needs to actually care.
