(Note: we've been residents here for ~2 years):\n\n1. Cockroaches. We have consistently had cockroaches in our unit (as you can see in the pictures) DESPITE being incredibly clean and paying thousands of dollars for a cleaning service monthly (think Maidsailors, Myclean, etc). We have raised this issue with management multiple times but they send us a temporary exterminator who spends 5 minutes in the unit just to put down paper traps and spray. This is an issue with the building itself.\n\n2. Loud noise and toxic fumes from constant construction. Due to a lot of construction held at the site, it's very loud in the unit during the day. So if you ever work from home or do any activities during the day, it will be incredibly disruptive for meetings or calls. The units are also being repainted and there is a toxic smell which lingers throughout the units, which is certainly a health hazard.\n\n3. Poor communication from the management. We reached out to the management (property manager named Walter) regarding incessant construction noise and toxic fumes. They took over 2 months to get back to us and only replied because we followed up. They then raised our rent by $200 and refused to provide any compensation for the loud noise, vermin, and toxic fumes caused by construction for MONTHS. They provided ZERO notice to residents about this and when asked about this issue, they replied over email: \"We don't have to ask or get permission from tenants for work we feel needs to be done.\"\n\nPositives: the doormen are very nice and friendly.
