I have used this service previously without any hiccups, but this time it took a while for the employee to believe that they even had my package or that I would ship it directly to the store before they finally checked the tracking number and easily placed it. Afterward, I was told to pay a $7 storage fee, which puzzled me since UO should’ve obviously covered that cost. After mentioning this to the employee, I was told that they weren’t aware of what was going on and that the storage fee was always a thing. And only after paying the fee and having left the store I saw that there was a big sticker slip on the package with a bold black number 3001 on it that said that my package was delivered and my storage fee was waived. I’m a little upset that I didn’t notice it sooner and that the employee failed to mention that, but that is obviously because they haven’t been informed of this, and the UPS software most likely failed to mention that under my order. I have no issue with the order or the employee, but I do not want to use the service of picking up my package at this UPS collection point again and fear encountering the same problem.
