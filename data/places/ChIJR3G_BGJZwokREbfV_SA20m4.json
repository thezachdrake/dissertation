In addition, having a store open 24 hours a day means high upkeep costs which translates to expensive prices; this store cannot even compare to the prices (or variety) that you can get at Fairway market just a couple blocks away. I ended up paying twice as much for a number of different items ranging from food products like quinoa to candy to fresh flowers. At the end of the day, the reason grocery stores aren't open 24 hours is because the business model doesn't make sense and the higher prices will turn most customers away, especially when Fairway is just down the street.
