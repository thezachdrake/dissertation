Dass aber derart gute Künstler der weitestgehenden Vergessenheit wie mit einem Paukenschlag regelrecht entrissen werden, ist wohl eher die Ausnahme. Genau das ist geschehen.\n\nEin solches höchst verdienstvolles Ereignis, die Präsentation eines vor vielen Jahrzehnten, zu seinen Lebzeiten schon einmal bekannten Künstlers, ist die bemerkenswerte und aufsehenerregende Wiederentdeckung von Fritz Ascher und seinem Werk.\n\nDrei Themen sind zu erwähnen:\n1.) Das Kennenlernen eines großen Künstlers, der teils nach Neigung und eigenem innerem Gesetz, teils von äußeren Umständen bis zur Lebensbedrohung gequält und gezwungen, in seiner Malerei eine zwar starke, lebhafte, vitale, aber überwiegend düster-dunkle Farbigkeit zeigt. Die Graphiken, ausschließlich Handzeichnungen, belegen Aschers ausgeprägte Fähigkeit, mit raschen, manchmal wie fahrig wirkenden Strichen das zentral Wesentliche einer Situation, eines Ereignisses, eines Eindruckes und einer Persönlichkeit zu erfassen und mit Kreide, Tuschpinsel oder Feder, hier bevorzugt die sensible, meisterlich gehandhabte Rohrfeder (Tanzende 1921) darzustellen.\nNach 1945 erscheint neu eine Farbmalerei, die den Gegenstand nur noch andeutet, ihn fast nicht  mehr braucht oder ihn mit fulminanten, eruptiven, düsteren, zerfetzten Farbstürmen geradezu überdeckt, bedeckt (Beethoven 1945). Später sind Sonne und Blume miteinander sehr verwandt, Bäume sind dramatisch bedrohte Individuen, die die überstandene Tortur zeigen.\nDie  späten Landschaften, ob mit Wasser, Mond oder Sonne, sind gemalte Erinnerungsräume oder -Ebenen, die das vorübergezogene Inferno zeigen, ohne Jubel, ohne Freude, ohne Triumph, man sieht in ihnen nur die geschundene Kreatur.\nDas sind eindrucksvolle an- und aufrührende Bilder in schockierender Direktheit, große Malerei.\n\n2.) Die Erwähnung gilt der großen Retrospektive \"Leben ist Glühen\" und seinem Katalog (knapp 300 Seiten) über Aschers Gesamtwerk, inkl. der Gedichte, welche in Deutschland seit 2016 (Osnabrück) an verschiedenen Orten (Chemnitz, Berlin, Potsdam) zu sehen war und ist. Ausstellungen in den USA sind geplant.\nMit bemerkenswertem Fleiß und ebensolcher Energie und Zähigkeit wurde seit vielen Jahren gesucht, zusammengetragen, geforscht, um den \"ganzen\" Ascher zeigen zu können. Die Recherchen, so belegt es der großartige Katalog (Englisch/Deutsch) waren gründlich, weit gestreut, profund und gut belegt und zeigen die gleiche Ernsthaftigkeit, wohl auch die intensive Betroffenheit der Autoren, wie sie Aschers Werk und Leben selbst charakterisiert.\nWas den Werken Aschers fehlt, ist eine feinsinnige, gelöste Heiterkeit, die Einladung zu zelebriertem, delikatem Kunstgenuss, auch alles Erzählerisch-Illustrative, alles dekorative Beiwerk fehlt. Des Künstlers Zeiten waren nicht so, dass dies alles auch noch hätte kultiviert werden können. Ausgelassenheit gab es nicht in Freude, nur in lebendiger Dramatik. Ascher war wesentlich.\n\n3.) Die Fritz Ascher Society for Persecuted, Ostracized and Banned Art, Inc. in New York und ihre Direktorin und CEO, Rachel Stern, hat in staunenswert wenigen Jahren die große, reich bestückte Ascher-Ausstellung und ihren gründlichen Katalog hervorgebracht. Das verdient Bewunderung und höchste Anerkennung."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en-US","text":"It is not uncommon in art history for highly talented artists, who were little or not noticed during their lifetime, to sink into complete obscurity after their death. But the fact that such good artists are literally snatched from widespread oblivion as if with a bang is probably the exception. That's exactly what happened.\n\nSuch a highly commendable event, the presentation of an artist who was already known many decades ago during his lifetime, is the remarkable and sensational rediscovery of Fritz Ascher and his work.\n\nThree topics are worth mentioning:\n1.) Getting to know a great artist who, partly according to inclination and his own inner law, partly tormented and forced by external circumstances to the point of threatening his life, shows in his painting a strong, lively, vital, but predominantly gloomy and dark color scheme. The graphics, exclusively hand drawings, demonstrate Ascher's pronounced ability to capture the central essence of a situation, an event, an impression and a personality with quick, sometimes erratic strokes and with chalk, ink brush or pen, here preferably the sensitive, masterfully handled ones Rohrfeder (Tanzende 1921).\nAfter 1945, a new color painting appeared that only hinted at the subject, almost no longer needed it or almost covered it with brilliant, eruptive, dark, tattered color storms (Beethoven 1945). Later, sun and flower are very related to each other, trees are dramatically threatened individuals that show the ordeal they have survived.\nThe later landscapes, whether with water, moon or sun, are painted memory spaces or planes that show the inferno passing by, without jubilation, without joy, without triumph; in them you only see the battered creature.\nThese are impressive, touching and stirring images with shocking directness, great paintings.\n\n2.) The mention goes to the large retrospective \"Life is Glow\" and its catalog (almost 300 pages) about Ascher's entire work, including the poems, which have been on display in Germany since 2016 (Osnabrück) in various places (Chemnitz, Berlin, Potsdam). see was and is. Exhibitions in the USA are planned.\nWith remarkable diligence and equal energy and tenacity, people have searched, compiled and researched for many years in order to be able to show the \"whole\" ashtray. The research, as the great catalog (English/German) shows, was thorough, wide-ranging, profound and well-documented and shows the same seriousness, and probably also the intense concern of the authors, that characterizes Ascher's work and life itself.\nWhat Ascher's works lack is a subtle, relaxed cheerfulness, the invitation to celebrated, delicate enjoyment of art, and everything narrative-illustrative and decorative accessories are missing. The artist's times were not such that all of this could have been cultivated. There was no exuberance in joy, only in lively drama. Ascher was essential.\n\n3.) The Fritz Ascher Society for Persecuted, Ostracized and Banned Art, Inc. in New York and its director and CEO, Rachel Stern, have produced the large, lavish Ascher exhibition and its thorough catalog in an astonishingly few years. This deserves admiration and the highest recognition."},"publishTime":"2017-10-20T12:53:07Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.8554878302915,"longitude":-73.93329681970849},"low":{"latitude":40.8527898697085,"longitude":-73.93599478029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","shortFormattedAddress":"121 Bennett Ave, New York"}
