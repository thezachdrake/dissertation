But thankfully to God for Mr. Smalls I got a divorced without losing or paying a dime to her and got myself back where I needed to be.  Unlike other lawyers who ends with you after it's said and done, Mr. Smalls does not do so making himself available to clients to keep in touch or contact him when needs be.  He is also always willing to answer calls of former and current clients.  The most recent legal service I received from Mr. Smalls and his office was when I got a ticket.  And when I called Mr. Smalls about it, he went to work right away and at the end the ticket was thrown out saving me a fine and points on my license.  I can go on and on about how an outstanding legal service Mr. Smalls and his office provide from divorce, traffic, criminal court incidents to counseling.  Whiles some law offices and lawyers care more about making money of you, I can say with my experience Mr. Smalls is a great family man who understands and feels for his clients....and will work hard work for them to exceed their expectations.  He cares more about people like you and I.  Lastly I would say if you are looking or searching for a legal service or a lawyer to present you in any kind of case and never not regret it then don't look anywhere else but the law office of Matthew Smalls...."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"It was a big blessing to have come across the law office of Matthew R.
