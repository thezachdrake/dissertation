She is an 80 years old women who had cateract surgery on both eyes with DR. Merriam.  She told me that her eyes are great now.  She did not need to pay extra for laser surgery.   She also live in Connecticut  thus it usually takes over an hour to see Dr. Merriam but she loves Dr. Merriam and his team.  She is his patient for many years.\n\nDr. Merriam is a great, talented eye surgeon.  He is very personable, caring and helpful.  I know that I can trust Dr. Marriam.  I had an eye infection in October and went to see a doctor in CT close to where I live.  The office administrative told me that I needed to recheck my eyes sight.   When it was an appointment day ,the Opthalmologist in CT told me that I needed a cataract surgery.  I was surprised because I could see well and I did not think that I had any problem with my eyes.  Specially my left eye is so good that I could read until the last line on the reading test thus I felt unsure why I needed a cataract surgery on both eyes.  I decided to have a second opinion.\n\nI had an appointment with doctor Marriam.  He checked my eyes with several methods.  I found out that I have astigmatism on my right eye.  For my cataract, Dr. Merriam told me that I did not need a surgery now.  I had an eyes infection one day before I went to see Dr. Marriam.  He kindly treated my eye infection as well.  I will go to see Dr. Merriam for recheck 6 months from now.  I am so grateful to find a honest doctor ( Harvard Graduated) like Dr. Merriam.  On my way out Dr. Merriam gave me a pear from his big box of pears.  He was so kind.  The whole team was awesome , Margarita and assistant and Ann Marie , Office coordinator.\n\nI recommend Dr. Marriam whole heartedly.  Thank you so much Dr. Merriam."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I went to see Dr. Merriam from the recommendation of  one of his patients.
