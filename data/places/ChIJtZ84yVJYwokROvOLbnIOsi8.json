I paid for the hotel and its amenities and priority was given to non hotel guests going to some bar. This caused a massive, unnecessary line to take the only two elevators available. A line that took up the whole lobby and 25-30 minutes just waiting for an elevator to my room. That lobby was as crowded as times square.

The only good thing that came from this stay was the service from the bell man Carlos. He is exceptional and honestly should not be working in such a poorly managed hotel that doesn’t care about their guests. He belongs in the best of hotels as he genuinely does care and provides the best of the best service.
