Now except for location, this has been a shockingly terrible experience at most levels.\n\nLet’s start with the basics of service - from the director of rooms to the late night staff, the idea of service doesn’t exist. They are quick to DEMAND payment, then forget to render a service which was charged for, and follow up attitude and apathy.\n\nWe are staying for 21 days. They demanded payment upfront and in full. Now they have 100% of my money and can do as they please and treat people as they want.\n\nLet’s start with a small incident of drinking water in the rooms. For 8 days, the process was to call the front desk and someone would bring water up to the rooms. On Day 9, the rules changed. Now there’s a charge. And the charge is unapologetically steep.\n\nWant trash removed from your room? It’s $75! It’s construed as “Service” and the director of rooms who likes to repeat the word doesn’t even know what she is charging $75 for. If you question the front desk for why the room hasn’t been cleaned despite paying the service charge - you get a hollow apology and then lies from the robots about how it was a system error etc.\n\nThe General Manager - sweet man etc, clearly is out of his depth running the hotel with a bunch of arrogant novices.\n\nThere are 3 outstanding members of their team however. All in the day shift - a chirpy man at the door who wants to go on a diet, and two lovely guys at the front desk. You know who you are.\n\nThe Cafe shut down mid-stay. No warning whatsoever. So, the hotel has no F&B. There are numerous restaurants around, and I would recommend stepping out anyways. There is no hob. Utensils aren’t cleaned daily or replenished. This is not a serviced apartment. It’s a hotel room with a microwave oven. So don’t be fooled by the idea of a large spacious serviced apartment. It’s a decent sized hotel room and that’s it.\n\nIt’s just a basic lack of empathy for the guest, and an over eager demand for payment upfront. What I don’t get is their attitude - the staff should be here BECAUSE of the guest and FOR the guest. So sitting on their chairs, responding as if we were intruding on their otherwise busy lives and speaking in a brusque tone is just not what hospitality is about.\n\nThe hotel needs to rebrand as a place to stay and NOTHING else. Bring your own everything except a basic bed and a basic shower. Nothing else works. Everything else is charged for. Easyhotel is much the same but at least they don’t pretend to be anything other than functional. After all the extra charges that will be added to provide basic service, I was probably better off staying at a full service hotel in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe sad thing is that I have another 10 days in this dump, as they have my money!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I stayed here years ago, and it was exceptional.
