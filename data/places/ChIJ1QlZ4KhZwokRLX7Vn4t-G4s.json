The scrub was painless very gentle, it was my first time when someone did a scrub for me with gloves and I was pleasantly surprised by the result after, my skin just shine and breathed. After the scrub, we went to another floor for a massage and it was so relaxing, all my stress was gone. At the end of all our procedures, we were served tea with pineapple.
