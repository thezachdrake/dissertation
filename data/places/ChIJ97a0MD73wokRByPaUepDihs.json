So off we scrambled to find a restaurant in Resy that can accommodate a group of 10 at 7pm on Friday. I also thought of this place as I've seen the wonderful reviews in the past. So I decided to call and they were able to squeeze us in.\n\nWe were given a long table and basically had our own little section upon entering. The place wasn't big but just right, with a nice bar and great music. Pretty good vibe. My husband and I weren't drinking but everyone loved the drinks especially the Holy Water. We also kicked it off with the Fritto Mix for 2 which had wings, mozarella sticks, calamari and popcorn shrimp with various sauces on the side. We enjoyed it.\n\nFor entrées, most of the group ordered the Ribeye and we unanimously agreed it was pretty good as well as the green beans that came with it. My husband ordered the Chicken Parmigiana dish and enjoyed it. We also ordered Spaghetti Bolognese just so we know how good their pastas are and it was delicious.\n\nFor desserts, we ordered flan, gelato, and the Tortino al Cioccolato with ice cream and this was a hit. The music also became better and better as the evening went by. Service was warm and attentive.   Interestingly, unlike other restaurants here that'll automatically charge you 20% or higher for big groups, they actually only charged us 18%, which made it easier for us to decide to add more gratuity of course. We also met Laura, the owner of the restaurant, as she was pretty nice and hands on. Thanks Laura and Team, for making it an enjoyable evening for all of us!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We had a reservation downtown for a friend's birthday dinner last Friday but the celebrant suddenly was running late and the original restaurant couldn't accommodate anything past 10 mins from the original reserved time.
