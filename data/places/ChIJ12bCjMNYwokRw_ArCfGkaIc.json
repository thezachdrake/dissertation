Didn't hear anything back UNTIL Feb 8th. February 8th the office called me and said that Dr. Souweidane suggested that my son have the surgery done. She said she was transferring me to another woman who I would give all my sons insurance information to. I spoke with her and emailed her everything she requested. They both told me that they would get back to us soon to schedule an appointment. I waited three weeks. Sent 3 emails to each of them asking for updates. No one email back. Last week I called the office on Monday and was told that it was a completely different woman I should be speaking with. Not the two that I had been emailing. I was told that they would put my number and my sons info on that womans desk and have her call me. Didn't receive a call. So Wednesday I called again. Same thing, was told they would call me right back after the woman got in. Friday I called again, was told that, that would call me back.  Tomorrow will be a Month since they called me to recommend surgery, a month of me contacting them and getting NO FORM OF ANY COMMUNICATION BACK.
