I tasted it and had that smoky mezcal taste. I’m glad I picked the one I did: I’m more into sweeter, fresher drinks.   Then our food arrived. I ordered the green pasta, literally it was green.  The creamy sauce needed a little bit of salt. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. The pasta was al dente. My hubby ordered the Steak: 7oz filet mignon, vegetables and fries.  He truly enjoyed his meal.
