However, my experience was not ideal to say the least.\n\nFirst, the nail techs in the salon were speaking in Mandarin to each other and did not bother to at least check and see if I could understand them (which I could). It was raining that day and my hair is naturally pretty thin so when it gets wet, it becomes even more apparent (something I am pretty self conscious about haha). When I first walked in, the older nail tech (HongYan) had made a comment to my nail tech (LingLing) saying in Mandarin “oh my this girls hair is falling out all over the place”, which I did not appreciate.\n\nSecond, I rarely ever complain about service but a basic French tip with a small simple design should not take 2.5 hours to do, around 1 hour for just the hearts. The nail tech (Lingling) doing my nails was trying her best she really was. But as she was redoing the hearts, she apologized to me in English but was complaining to HongYan in Chinese how “she does not want to do it anymore”, “drawing these hearts are annoying”. And then her coworker (HongYan) came over to see what was taking so long and said to her “just give her one heart it’s fine and call it a day.” And as time grew later and later, more customers started coming in and the HongYan would make comment to LingLing saying “these hearts took so long that other customers are having to wait,” which I did feel bad about, but I hardly think that is because of me.\n\nAs some more customers came in, they were commenting to each other saying things like “ugh these people reek of weed” “it’s giving me a headache” etc etc.\n\nOverall, with the nails themselves the quality of the finished product isn’t as nice as i have had previously at some other places. The French tip color did not fully cover the tip of the nail. From the front it looks alright! Just felt as if the product was incomplete as a result.
