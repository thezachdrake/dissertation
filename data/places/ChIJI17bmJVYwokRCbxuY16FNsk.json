Some years ago I had engaged a  plastic surgeon who preformed blepheroplasty, lipostructure , and some small lifts for me of which I endured poor results.  Not only did Dr. Jelks repair what had been done previously, he improved my results dramatically!  His bedside manner was professional and skilled. He spent time with me during my pre-op appointments, post-op visits, and answered all my questions thoroughly. I am most impressed by his attention to detail of his work as well as  his extensive pre-and post op instruction.  The office staff at Jelks Medical is superb. Professional and caring, they ensured my comfort and safety during all aspects of my surgery and follow up. His office manager Gina, was amazing. She helped me navigate through every step of the process and even accommodated my schedule easily when I had to change an appointment at the last minute.  She arranged for me to have a private RN who accompanied me for 2 days after my procedure around the clock to monitor for problems and remind me to follow the instructions to the letter. I would highly recommend Dr. Jelks and his staff to anyone wishing to undergo plastic surgery."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Extremely satisfied with my recent experience with Dr Glenn Jelks.

I could not have had a better experience with the evaluation, office staff, surgery and results.  I had a complicated case of overly wide-open eyes and sagging upper lids and was in need of an upper and lower eyelid surgery and had a few other concerns vis a vis premature aging.   I have a medical background and spoke with five of the top physicians in the field in NYC. I consulted with Dr. Jelks on the recommendation of a world renown retired plastic surgeon and I could not be more thankful.   No one came close to the level of precision in terms of explanation and expectation of results.  I had the eyelid surgery, as well as fat injections to fill out my face and a chin suction and the results were far and above what I expected.  I am also highly inflammatory and have extremely sensitive skin -- so had a few bumps that made me nervous and prompted me to call him more than several times.  He was always prompt and happy to take my calls and explain in detail the process of healing and my particular process, and after two weeks out I looked and felt amazing.  I am now nine months out and I look and feel incredible.  The best part is people will ask me if I have changed my hair or am on a new health kick -- but no one even knows I had plastic surgery.  He is an extremely thoughtful and meticulous surgeon, and his outcomes are to make you look naturally younger -- not artificially enhanced in any way.  Dr. Elizabeth Jelks -- his partner is equally as wonderful and skilled -- and evaluates all occullar surgery candidates.  His staff and office manager Gina are warm, responsive and professional and really worked with my insane schedule to make post-op check ups convenient.   I cannot recommend him enough."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Wow -- I cannot disagree with the last reviewer more.
