I was excited to try the unique beet ravioli but this was another meh dish that was presented much better than it tasted. The cod was fine, nothing special, the sauce was good but still felt very basic. The dessert options were all terrible, our table tried the gingerbread cranberry, chocolate layered mouse and the apple pie and the pie was the best option, but the others weren't worth finishing.
