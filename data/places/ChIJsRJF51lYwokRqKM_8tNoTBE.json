We do not get paid we just love to eat and have fun.  We really love Jaz Indian Cuisine restaurant.  Just opened in early 2022 but already has a great reputation and was voted best resturant in Hell's Kitchen.  Well deserved.  We ate at the bar and the bartender was the owner \"Jaz\".  We explained we had rarely had Indian food so she designed our menu.  Not sure of all the things she ordered for us, but all of them were awesome.  We did get garlic Naan which is a thin fried flat bread that was great for dipping all of the food.  I had a lamb dish and Maria had a shrimp dish and a chicken dish.  All of them were full of flavor.  You tell them the heat amount you want.  We started at zero and went to 5.  We probably would have preferred 5 to 8 next time, but we wanted to start low just to be sure we were not overwhelmed.  The heat they use is full of flavor, which we really liked.  Be sure to get the fried onion things with green dipping sauce, they are super delicious.  I think they are called Onion Fritters.  Lovely.  We got 3 desserts that had names I could not pronounce.  All of them are really good.  Jaz is a great place and Jaz herself is fun to talk to as well as some of the regulars that sit at the bar.  About 20 tables but get a reservation to avoid the wait.  Full bar here and drinks were strong and reasonably priced.  Be sure to have Jaz suggest food and drinks, she is the best!!!!  Check out all of our reviews. If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic. Follow us if you like. We had over 36 million views so far this year and we thank you for that.
