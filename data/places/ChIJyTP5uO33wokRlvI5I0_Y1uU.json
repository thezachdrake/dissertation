It is because of doctors like her who neither listen nor take a patient’s complaints seriously  why I avoided seeing doctors. She barely made an effort in discussing my health history. Not that I would be making a follow-up, but she didn’t even tell me when she wanted to see me again. Just shocked and baffled by how dismissive and uncaring this doctor was. If you want to feel belittled, go ahead, make an appointment and see her. At least the belittling will only be 20 minutes.\n\nUPDATE (2/8/24): I had blood test performed at the first and only visit and she still has not reached out to advise me of the results. the results were sent to mychart and initially, it said my results have not been reviewed by my care team. it now no longer has that message so I think it is safe to assume my 'care team' has reviewed them. it has been over 1 week with no update.

I am a patient in need and she is showing great indifference and this is amounting to gross negligence."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Truly disappointed.
