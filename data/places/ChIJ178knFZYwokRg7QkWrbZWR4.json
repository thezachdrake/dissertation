I washed up here last fall in a post natal haze and a knee injury that made even climbing stairs a challenge. I was assigned Alaina, who listened closely to my issues and worked with me slowly and steadily to get me back to fitness. I owe her everything positive about my body now! Having eavesdropped on the other PTs with their patients, I am pretty sure that the others are equally awesome. The communal atmosphere with its large, airy and sunlit open space made such a difference, even in the depths of winter. Listening to the banter of the Broadway community made the experience extra special. This place feels like a special village where you go to heal in all sorts of ways - not with fancy equipment, but very sound medicine and a lot of heart. And a special shout out to Sherri, who just makes my day when I walk through the door by emanating good cheer (and an amazing scent from her aromatherapy diffuser). She is the expert on all things insurance and was kind enough to refer one of my friends who wasn't covered for Neurosport to a practice that would take her insurance. Your account is safe in her hands! Please keep going here, they are taking extreme precautions with covid and will keep you safe."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Wonderful practice with a really kind and caring team of PTs who know what they are doing.
