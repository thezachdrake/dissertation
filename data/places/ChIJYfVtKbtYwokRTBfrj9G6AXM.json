The second stronger version (the one that should’ve initially been used) was essentially what I paid for. Pretty much got scammed out of the Groupon deal. I then went ahead and purchased a laser hair removal deal directly from her. Big mistake because she burned me. BIPOC be wary because we are not test subjects. She did not apply any gel to my chin area. If I could upload the photos to this review you will be horrified. My wife warned me several times not to go back but I always give people the benefit of the doubt (yes, even after I was burned). I then had an upcoming appointment where she contacted me and asked me to come in earlier because she had a communion party to attend. Later on that same day, she then contacted me to cancel the appointment because her cat died. Not to be apathetic but it just seemed too coincidental. Ultimately, enough was enough and I requested a refund for the remainder of the scheduled treatments. She indicated that she would send it but I have yet to receive it. I had to do a chargeback with my bank. Very poor experience and again, she is very unprofessional.
