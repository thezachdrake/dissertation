We reassured her multiple times about having a stable financial situation and about understanding the 20+ year commitment that is owning a cat, as we currently already own another cat. She encouraged us to proceed with the rest of the application via email and did not update us for over 48 hours. We came to visit the kitten we were interested in and she pulled us aside to explain that she can’t adopt the cat to us because she believes we are not ready due to being “too young” and for recently moving to New York. She also explained that the applications are first come first serve and reassured us that she does not consider one application over the other, however when she told us we weren’t able to adopt, she said it was because someone else applied and she preferred that application over ours. I understand the hesitance to adopt to young adults however, I do not think it was correct to assume that we were not ready financially and mentally just because we are young. I also believe that it was unprofessional of her to have us continue with the application with these doubts. If she new she was going to deny us or consider other applications because of our age, then she shouldn’t have had us continue with the application process. It felt as if any reassurance that we provided was completely disregarded and unheard. It also felt like we were being talked down to and treated like children throughout the entire process. We were very excited to adopt a new cat and to be denied because of an assumption of our lives and appearance was not only unfair, but frankly very disrespectful.
