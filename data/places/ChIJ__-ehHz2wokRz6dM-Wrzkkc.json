I was so excited to had found this day care because of the extended hours so I can take on some additional shifts at work. And to be honest because the staff was Black.  The director sold me a dream. She lead me to believe I can trust her and her staff. Long story short I came there to pick him up on several different occasions only to find out my son had been hurt not one time did they call me. The first time I came there he had a BUSTED lip. I asked what happen they said he hit himself opening the door to the toy kitchen set. I asked why didn't they call me? They felt it wasn't a big deal. The second time my son was BITTEN,  they didn't call because  his skin wasn't  broken. The third time I came there to pick him up early I looked in the window and found my son PINNED  UP on a GLASS  WINDOW in between CURTAINS by THREE year old boy. I watched for a second because i wanted to see how long it would take for the teacher to notice then ran inside. I  was furious but held my composure and spoke to the director. She assured me this would not happen again and that he would not be merged with the older class anymore. The fourth time I came there to pick him up and found that he was again merge with older children. I almost  lost it. Because the director  gave me her word. I trusted her word even after all that has happened.  Their communication is poor. I asked her why was he merge  with older children again after I pleaded with her please just call his father if you guys have to merge the classes he work in the neighborhood. One of us can pick him up. She lied to my face and told me she didn't know after the teacher already explained that this is something  they do everyday. I told her she could have just told me that the first time and I would have made the proper arrangements. They made it very  hard for me to trust again.  I didn't put my son back in day care I quit my job and waited until he was able to go to school at 3. I would not trust this staff.  I would give them a ZERO  if I could."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I put my son in this daycare at the age of 1.
