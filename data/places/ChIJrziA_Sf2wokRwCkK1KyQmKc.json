If you don’t specify and they do whole body, they won’t always do your feet, so if you want that, be sure to ask. Also, it’s good to specify if you want harder or softer pressure. The rooms are only separated by curtains so you can hear if people are talking or if there is honking on the street, but for such a great price and massage, I don’t mind at all.
