That's the way I see this college. It may be a little bit expansive but when it's about our future we have to invest first. Everything in this college is great. Let me start sharing me experience with you:\n\nI come from a small country from Europe, where we have a completely different system than here that seems to be a completely stress-free. My English level was not so good, and I still find it difficulty sometimes, but it was not a obstetrical for me at all, because all the professors helped me. And I am definitely glad for all the professors that I had, for 19 of them (5 quarters until now), they are all gorgeous. They never stop telling their student to use them as much as possible. They are respectful, patient, helpful, easy to understand, and they will try everything and every method for the student to succeed, after that is up to the students. If you do what the professors tell you to do you'll be fine, and that's what I and all my friends do. And we enjoy time in the class, we work in group, we discuss and bring new topics in class related with the lectures. And what is the beauty of Berkeley College is the diversity that it has. I consider myself lucky to have peers form different part of the world, because in an easy way help me to learn more about what's going around and try to understand other cultures too, thing that is very important if you live in a city as New York.\n\nI agree with a review here that in short terms tells that Berkeley College is a easy college to enter in because it accept everyone. That's true! But that's what make this college a successful college, because it gives everyone an opportunity. Just because you didn't do well doesn't mean that your life should end there, no college any more no career, nothing. No! That's why Berkeley College has hired good professors, where mostly of them has a PhD degree. And if that is not enough Berkeley College offers Academic Support Center tutoring to make our life easier.\n\nAnother great thing that I like at Berkeley College is that the stuff and the professors will define you by your name, not by your ID number, which makes me feel very good and think that people who work here care for me. And I am never lost in the class, like in the big colleges.
