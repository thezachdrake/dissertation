At first I wanted to have Asurion come to me to fix my phone but would have had to wait several days.

The process was very easy and smooth; you just set up an appointment on line and then walk in. Alexander was the attendant helping me and he was very nice. The only criticism I have is that you have to be sure and ask tons of questions to ensure you walk out with a clear idea of the process. You should also be sure to call in periodically to get updates because they won’t proactively do it (even if they say they will). That’s not a big deal, though, and the service was speedy; I was able to pick up my phone a few hours later and write this review!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I tripped walking up the subway stairs this morning on my way into the office.
