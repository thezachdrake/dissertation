It took forever for our food to come out but when it did it was piping hot and delicious.   I was skeptical of order the lamb chops as I feared it wouldn’t be seasoned or cook well.  Let me tell you I’m glad I was proven wrong.  The lamb chops were so delicious. As I’m writing this review, I’m reminiscing over the taste.
