Immediately following my session with Abel, my head pain was gone, and the swelling immensely diminished, something that enabled me to go back to work and drastically improved my quality of life overall.\n\nI have been receiving cranio sacral work since I was 12 from many practitioners, and Abel is one of the most gifted Craniosacral therapists I have had the honor of receiving work from. This past summer, I suffered from TMJ and hearing loss; after every western and eastern modality had failed to resolve the problem, I called Abel, because I trusted that he would treat all of me and not just one or two symptoms at a time. He worked closely with me, using a variety of modalities, and restored my hearing and created space in my body for my TMJ to resolve.\n\nThere are many bodyworkers that understand the body-mind connection and how to treat the physical body, but few bodyworkers recognize that the body-mind connection is as individual and unique as each client. Abel does. Because of my sessions with Abel, my understanding and awareness of my body, my alignment, and how my body and mind work together for me, are all increased. I highly highly recommend Abel as a bodyworker and healer."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Abel is a uniquely talented, extremely knowledgeable and gifted healer.
