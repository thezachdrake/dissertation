That is very good for me. They have kept me fairly busy, but not so much that I am being overly programmed out. They have a great balance here is programming, meals, and personal time. So far I'm very comfortable here at The Odyssey House. I've got a very good feeling about those place and cannot wait to continue on my journey on recovery. I've got big plans for my future and so far Odyssey House like like the right place to help me make my goals happen!!!

They do not contain a rule and regulation that says a no-pet policy They also tried to evict me and my emotional support animals illegally, and they also threatened to call animal control on my support animals. Be aware of a couple of odyssey houses like Odyssey house park ave and odyssey house harbor. At odyssey house harbor they have a few staff that are decent, and some that are rude. Speaking from experience. They have residents that been living here for years. Past the exceeded amount of time they suppose to be here. They lose people medications. They lose some tenants sensitive documents. My mail was tampered with. At park ave and at the harbor odyssey houses. They go into some people Apartments without their authorization. Not a good place to live. Some staff do not know how to speak to the tenants in a professional manner. They continue to violate our tenants bill of rights(A year ago). (Update Aug 21,2020) The peer specialist at park ave Grabbed my arm in the street and squeezed it  about 4 weeks ago or so and the peer specialist also lied on me and he got caught in his lie. The peer specialist is under investigation for that. The CEO Peter Provet of Odyssey house inc. was aware of me being put through mental abuse here at Odyssey house park ave, he told me he couldn't help me. Peter Provet should be ashame of himself, right along with most staff at odyssey house inc who mistreats the tenants. The maintenance man Stanley Jackson doesnt clean this building like he should especially with COVID-19 GOING AROUND. Office of Mental Health on 5th Avenue are not on top of Odyssey House Inc to see if things are being run properly in these places all they care about is the money. This just comes to show that some staff don't care about us here or at the harbor Odyssey House they're not trying to help anyone with housing I just feel like they are messing with our lives they take us as a joke. Verbal agreements are not legit here or at the  Harbor Odyssey House. This just comes to show that people with mental health are not being taken seriously. Odyssey houses mission is to improve Mental Health and to prevent homelessness they are doing the complete opposite. About 3 weeks ago there was a tenant walking around here with a knife planning to stab someone. I do not feel safe for me and my animals here, staff do not realize that we have to live with these circumstances while staff go home and they're safe and were not. The security guards during the night fall asleep on the job they were a few times where I couldn't even come in the building where i pay rent at, because the security guard fell asleep. It's enough that the security guards don't even watch the cameras knowing that they should watch the cameras often because sometimes things happens here with the tenants where they would fight each other or a tenant may have a weapon. I feel like the vice presidents of odyssey house Inc really need to open their eyes and the CEO of Odyssey House Inc definitely needs to open his eyes, and realize that things happen here that they need to address immediately. I am a mental health advocate and I helped my fellow Neighbors that needs help. I will continue to let God use me to help others, and for those staff members who do not want to help us, and continue to mistreat us and take our money, they will reap what they sow. I will say that the Art Program is the only place that ever made me feel at home, Jerald and Chad who runs the Art program at Odyssey house harbor on the 6th floor..never mistreated me, they always treated me with respect and courtesy, and I thank them for allowing to be part of the Art program."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"About three or four staff members here are unprofessional.
