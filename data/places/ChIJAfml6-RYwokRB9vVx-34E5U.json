Prior me becoming Dr. Kozikowska’s patient, I tried to address my issues with 5 different psychiatrists. All that experience took about 6 months, without any real progress. I ended up in the Dr. Kozikowska office in a pretty rough shape.  Her understanding and knowledge of how to deal with multiple conditions that I presented to her,  really saved me from myself.  I have been followed her every advice ever since. Dr. Kozikowska will never push any medication on you. She is very patient with her patients, and is willing to work with the person offering the least possible dose of any medication, and is always seeking your feedback on how you are progressing.  She has so many years of experience, that I trust her advice absolutely.  She’s been able to find the most effective treatment for me personally, plus she referred me to a great psychologist that also helped.  So if you ever struggle with a mood disorder, or just any disorder that fits into the area of psychiatry, you will not find a better Dr. than Dr. Kozikowska."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve been a patient of Dr.Kozikowska for about 9 years.
