E.g.\n1) Their facility is small and crowded and has no adequate activity space for the children during the winter. They try to market it as \"children love to feel at home, so we don't want to overwhelm them by open space\". But I know no child who loves to be locked up in his bedroom for 8 hours straight.\n2) Their teachers are \"Montessori trained\" as opposed to \"Montessori certified\", which they present as a big advantage while criticizing the process of Montessori certification in the USA.\n3) Their place is so small and crowded that they have no space to store strollers, and I mean *no storage space*. Strollers are not allowed past the door. Again they go under the slogan \"children love small spaces. But children's play space has nothing to do with stroller storage. What it means to you is that you'll have to carry your child in your arms from the train station while hearing about how superbly small the facility is.\n\nThere's something hypocritical in Tatjana Matano's rhetoric about how she runs the place.\n\nAdditionally, there were cultish things which bothered me, e.g. they repeatedly advised my wife to throw out the toy kitchen our son had, because \"children should play only with 'real' objects\". Under the same agenda, they show educational videos of mommys bathing their children with GLASS jars, because PLASTIC is not an \"organic material\" and evil for a child.\n\nFinally, once the Montessori Beginnings class was done, we were on their waiting list for their full time program.... for a long long time. I was not excited about them, but my wife was and got her way. Except after several months, my wife got anxious, emailed the director asking about the status of the waitlist and Tatjana said \"I thought hard, and decided not to accept your son as he's too active for us and his energy level will be a STRAIN ON OUR COMMUNITY\".\n\nThat's not ok on so many levels. If you want to reject someone, let them know as soon as you make the decision. Don't lead them on. And then, no rejection is nice to hear, but mind the wording!\n\n\"A STRAIN ON OUR COMMUNITY\" - how can these words be applied to a two year old boy?\n\nMeanwhile, our son was accepted both to the Central Park West Montessori, and the MMS (Metropolitan Montessori School).  Luckily for us, these two much more prestigious and educated establishments didn't think our son was a strain on their community.\n\nRiverside Montessori has *Montessori CERTIFIED* teachers and a plastic toy kitchen in their toddler room! So I guess these people, who've done more extensive training don't think that playing with \"fake non-organic objects\" damages the child.\n\nMMS discouraged us from going over the top trying to reproduce their environment (unlike Renaissance, who encourage you to throw out your toy kitchen). They said \"just be loving parents at home, if you exhaust your child with Montessori activities at home, they'll come to us and will not want to engage with the materials, we had parents who did that and it didn't work well for their children\".\n\nIn other words, much classier places are more tolerant, more flexible, less hypocritical, and less offensive.\n\nFinally Dr Tatjana Matano, Phd is throwing her degree left and right to add herself credibility. It's ironic that she's boasting her diploma while downplaying the value of Montessori certification.\n\nIf you spend 1 minute Googling \"Lev Ratinov\", it'll be easy to convince yourself I have a real Phd. I haven't seen any publications by Tatjana Matano, and don't have any idea about her credibility as a Phd.
