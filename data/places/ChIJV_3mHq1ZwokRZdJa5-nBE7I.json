I am a Master Teacher of Modern dance styles in addition to Ballet, Jazz and other styles. I hold certifications from major dance institutions and have had a long career as a performer, teacher and choreographer. I was very curious to explore H+ and did so by starting with their 3 hour \"Community Class\". I was welcomed, as were all the new and regular participants with open arms and big hugs afterward. The Executive Director, Safi A. Thomas, extremely gifted and talented in many areas has created a unequaled dance conservatory which goes far beyond most dance companies, creating an outstanding dance company, unparalleled teaching, codification of the Hip Hop genre of dance. I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 hour Community Class experience. It began with a meditation exercise outstretching your arms for 15 minutes and creating stillness within the body and mind to prepare you for a trip around the globe in Hip Hop Dance styles. On the night I was there a young person was next to me for her first class too. Accustomed to holding my arms out for 45 minutes in Jazz classes performing isolations prepared me for the 15 minute exercise which can be daunting for any dancer, I was able to perform. The young person who was new to the class found it excruciating and was crying--not because it was physically impossible, but because she did not have the confidence or training to perform it. I watched the teachers, easily identified by their Adidas Black outfits (which was very helpful and I loved that there was a \"clean\" look to the uniform as would be in a ballet class. They were easily identified by the same athletic clothing). I listened in to the teachers as they came around to coach the struggling dancers. Every person was coached in a positive, friendly and supportive way.  The class was extremely challenging but not too difficult for someone my age and there was nothing I was asked to do that I have not been asked in other dance classes and styles. I loved the fact that the company dancers were dispersed throughout to give assistance and corrections. At the same time, it provides teacher training to the company members.  It was wonderful to be taught by extremely knowledgeable, well-trained teachers. Mr. Thomas has fabulous DJ skills and provided the custom music for the class, which was wonderful, too. Unlike other dance classes where a teacher must stop and reset the music, when most are not afforded live accompaniment, it kept the flow of the class going. The standards promoted discipline, which, if one has aspirations to dance in any style, are a must to prepare an individual for the art which is dance.  Failure to maintain discipline in a dance career can set one up for failure in the career, which dictates a high level of discipline and criterion. Following this superb class, I followed the Conservatory and dance company and have since gone to several concerts and workshops. Each of the Executives are incredible individuals, highly accomplished and continually growing their superb company beyond the commonplace. It is rare to encounter such modesty, humility and humanity in an arts organization. I have come to know some of the principals personally and I can endorse The Hip Hop Dance Conservatory with the highest recommendation.  Oh, by the way, the young person who struggled along side of me that night a year ago, is now a promising dance company member."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am an adult beyond the \"median age\"  of The Hip Hop Dance Conservatory company dancers and teachers.

They have these community classes every friday for $20 each class! What a sweet deal!\n\nI've taken a lot of hip hop classes before where you just learn choreographed dances and then you perform the sequence at the end of the class. I've been looking for a class like this where they actually teach you the foundations of hip hop and the moves!!!\n\n1) It's a 3-hour class. Bring water!!! It WILL get hot but they have fans and windows opened. They had several breaks in between each section of the class. I didn't find them to restrict us on how much water we can drink like previous reviews said.\n\n2) The first hour or so is freestyle. I think this is a way for people to warm up and socialize. If you don't like socializing, you can stay in your corner too. But let loose! You came to class for a reason. Why come to class if you're not willing to learn something new? I must admit, it was awkward in the beginning but then everybody else started dancing, so eventually you start to imitate moves from people all around you.\n\n3) Next, the class. We learned styles from East coast to West coast, moves like the running man, popping and locking, some breaking, etc. I LOVED IT ALL!!!\n\n4) Yes, there are assistants to help you and they will offer advice. Listen to them! Don't get caught up on what the instructor is moving on to. If you're not going to do the moves right, why bother learning?!\n\n5) Pace: I wouldn't recommend this class to absolute beginners, but go try it out anyway! You never know if you don't try. I felt like the instructors gave sufficient breakdown of the moves that you can follow. Of course they can't spend too much time on each move as there is a lot to be covered in such little time.\n\n6) They did NOT separate me from my friends like other reviews said. We just didn't stand next to each other because you can learn more by watching other people.\n\n7) They didn't force beginners to stand in front. I didn't feel any sort of intimidating vibe from anybody here. They were all nice and really just trying to help you. I would actually recommend standing in the front row anyway because that's how you can really see the instructor.\n\n8) They do videotape you though, so expect that when you go.\n\nGo in with an open mind and don't be afraid to learn."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the only review about this place you'll need to read.
