She said we would take care of it and within 6 months we could achieve a better look! (1st picture is the 1st fix up) I gave myself about a year to come to her for bleaching. I had long heavy toned out color and I just needed her to work her magic. She took all day with me but never rushed any part of the process. I appreciated that because I left with the most fluffiest and healthy feeling hair even after bleach. I wanted a some type of brown, but we started off with an ashy color. It was different for me but I wanted to try something new. Im still getting used to this color but I know that if I wanted to go honey brown she would make it happen without a problem. Plan is to grow out my hair again and do long back layers. Right now, just wanted to neutralize my hair dimensions and she did just that. Honestly, Im mostly pleased and super thankful for the fact that my hair feels so healthy and nothing was rushed. I’ve definitely gave her work but she worked through it!
