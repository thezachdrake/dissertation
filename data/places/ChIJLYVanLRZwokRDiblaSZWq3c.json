The amount of time and precision this man put into perfecting the length of the dress that afternoon due to the manufacturing problem was actually incredible to witness - I picked up the dress today (Wednesday), the dress was pressed perfectly and looked beautiful! His workmanship and care of garments is beyond apparent. He shared stories of all the luxury clothing work he’s done for so many years and showed me other pieces he was working on.
