This place has limited seating (expect queues) and is a short walk from Union square."},"publishTime":"2024-01-07T15:23:27Z"}],"dineIn":true,"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.734224230291495,"longitude":-73.99246121970849},"low":{"latitude":40.7315262697085,"longitude":-73.99515918029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":11,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":23,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":11,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":23,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":11,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":23,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":11,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":23,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":11,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":23,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":11,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":23,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":10,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":23,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM","Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM","Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM","Thursday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM","Friday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM","Saturday: 10:00 AM – 11:00 PM","Sunday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"60 University Pl, New York","servesCoffee":true}
