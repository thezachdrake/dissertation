I was told by the building broker Amelia at 181 east 119 st that I am able to put up a wall to convert my space and personal showed me a converted flex  apartment. So great I sign the lease and move in. When my professional wall guys came , the building 181 east 119 st  completely restricted it . after I paid 1500 for the walls . so that money went into the dumpster cause all the material was paid for . now I have 8 month here and have an eviction notice from the building for having guest in my apartment . The funny part they is no noise complaint or any damages .  I Have always paid rent on time.
