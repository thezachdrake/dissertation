His attention to detail and easy, relaxed energy truly put me at ease while planning such an important occasion. The attention to detail that he put into crafting each of the menus was obvious from the outset, and before tasting a single creation of his I knew he would deliver. Needless to say he exceeded even my high expectations, serving up a superbly delicious, meticulously executed wedding celebration that left each of my guests blown away. I truly enjoyed the energy he brought to the proceedings, which can best be described as calm, warm and easy, and it was amazing to see he and his team in the kitchen so carefully and easily executing their work. His ability to tailor the menu to suit a myriad of tastes, as well as his genuinely fun, friendly demeanor. As for the food, it  was truly perfect, and I don’t say that lightly. Every dish was flawlessly plated, every bite more delicious than the last.\n\nI would highly, highly recommend Chef Chris for any occasion or event you may be hosting. His professionalism, friendliness, and skill at leaving everyone blown away by what they’ve just eaten is reason enough to seek him out, and I cannot thank him enough for making the most important occasion in mine and my husband’s life thus far that more more memorable due to his incredible talent.
