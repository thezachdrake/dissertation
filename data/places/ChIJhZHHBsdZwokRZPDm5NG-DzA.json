And once the woman signal for me to come in, I came in .oh my goodness this room is so beautiful And all of these beautiful girls were there dressed in pink. the same woman that I had met outside, said to me, do you like it and I said I love it and she said do you think people like this place. I said “what are you talking about“ have you ever shopped here before this is absolutely beautiful.
