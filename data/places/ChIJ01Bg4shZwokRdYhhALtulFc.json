We were celebrating an event and they were able to put some celebratory candles in the dessert and change the music to the song of our choice.\n\nThe food was all around great as well. The pani puri dish tasted like your typical pani puri, but presentation is key with the pani served in light bulbs with a spout. It was a fun experience, but it was unique to be shaking pani into the puri like hot sauce. The bok choy chaat was tasty and honestly tasted like regular pakoda - it's a great way to hide veggies. The chipotle chicken tikka was the star of the appetizers imo - the chicken was SO soft and flavorful, the marinade was so creamy. The sauce it comes with adds a smoky flavor to the chicken, but doesn't need anything to accentuate the flavor.\n\nThe mushroom biryani was flavorful and a great vegetarian option. The jackfruit khadi was probably the spiciest dish of the night - it almost felt like a malai kofta feel or pakodi/kadi feel to it, but the jackfruit was spiced and fried into a very crunchy, yet not dry, nugget. The lemon chicken was also delicious and the chicken was very soft.\n\nDessert was delicious (gulab jamun creme brulee), the custard was silky and the gulab jamun embedded in it was soft. Overall a hit! The flavors were very typical indian flavors but with new ingredients brought to the table."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is a cute little restaurant that seats no more than 25 people at a time.
