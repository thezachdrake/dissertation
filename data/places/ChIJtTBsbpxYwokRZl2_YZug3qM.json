It is my entire livelihood, and I had a vocal contract coming up that was incredibly important to me. I had been having vocal problems for over a month, and I was desperate for an actionable plan of treatment. At this point, my voice problems were bad enough it had been making it hard for me to even work, and I was struggling.\n\nI went to see Dr. Peak Woo very hopeful to finally receive an answer. I waited an hour in the waiting room past my appointment time. I was really nervous, and I was there on a referral from my regular ENT who felt I was beyond the help she could give in her office. I’d seen so many Doctors in the past month. When I finally was called back to see Doctor Woo, to my dismay, they didn’t take the time to adequately go over my medical history. I had to stop him multiple times to try to give him the information I knew was relevant to my case via my previous ENT. I was not listened to. I was not heard.\n\nAfter they scoped me, the Doctor told me I had a dilated blood vessel on my left vocal cord. I digested this, and asked him what I could do to treat this problem. He told me to “just try singing” and that it would go away or it wouldn’t. He told me if it didn’t, I would need to have a procedure done.\n\nThis was incredibly stressful to hear, and I had a lot of questions, as this diagnosis didn’t begin to explain all the symptoms I had tried to outline for him. I also felt I needed a more comprehensive overview as to what I should/should not be doing to get better and avoid hurting myself. I was shuffled out of the office without those answers, and was told to “call him if I wanted surgery”. That cost me over $400.\n\nI walked out in a haze, and as soon as I processed, I sent him a follow up email with more detailed questions not 15 minutes after leaving his office. 30 minutes later I received an email back full of one word answers (and some gaslighting about what I was told less than an hour ago). At this point, I felt completely defeated, and had a good cry.\n\nThat could have been it had I not looked for a second opinion from another otolaryngologist.\n\nI’m so glad I did, because the other doctor took time to comprehensively go over my symptoms and medical history. He scoped me with a vocal therapist in the room to get his opinion. After a detailed evaluation, he informed me my vocal cords were in perfect health. He even showed me on a video so I could see for myself.\n\nI walked out of that appointment with a diagnosis of muscle tension dysphonia, standing weekly appointments with one of their vocal therapists, and a comprehensive treatment plan. Since then my recovery has been exponential.\n\nI’m not writing this to bash Dr Woo. I see from other reviews that he is excellent at surgical procedures, and I probably would have been in good hands - had I needed one. But the thing is. I didn’t need one, and this Doctor who knew I was a singer, misdiagnosed me and tried to pressure me into a procedure anyway.\n\nSo I just want others to be aware. If you go to Dr Woo, and he gives you a scary diagnosis, go get a second opinion.\n\nOr maybe heed my warning and get your first opinion somewhere else as well. I certainly will."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"If I hadn’t gotten a second opinion, this doctor could have wrecked my life.\n\nI am a singer for my job.
