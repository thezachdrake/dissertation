We ordered 2 half chickens which came with beans and rice, a side of roast pork, octopus salad, and a chicken noodle soup. The chicken was solid and flavorful, I chose the yellow rice while my friend chose the yellow rice with peas (I recommend the ladder if you like beans). My friend and I both chose the black beans, let me tell you as a non bean eater these kind of wowed me in a simplistic manner as they had a subtle yet complex flavor to them. For me just a side of the roast pork was perfect as it was very good just rich. My friend got the chicken noodle soup which was very good. We were both shocked at how big the portion was with not just broth actual chunks of chicken and vegetables. The octopus salad was the only thing I would not get again while good I just did not think that it was worth $19 dollars. Overall this is one of the best most satisfying meals I’ve had in a while. Also, with a total of $60 it does not hurt that the price to food ratio is outstanding even keeping up with places outside the city.
