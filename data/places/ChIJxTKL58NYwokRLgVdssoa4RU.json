This review was put up a year ago and was on a review on the wrong doctor. My review concerns the 2 ladies at the reception and another for the nurse for Dr. Levy. I set an appointment with Dr. Levy months in advance to check for my daughters eye sight. She had the common cold a week before that and was recovering from that. We got the “ok” from our pediatrician and other doctors from the Weill Cornell group that she was ok to go to daycare and interact with other people. When we reached the hospital, I was asked for the physical insurance card, which I didn’t have with me since I’ve uploaded a copy through the portal and I never had to use the physical copy for any of the clinics or hospitals within the Weill Cornell group so I didn’t carry it with me. The receptionist lady asked me to bring it next time around when I visit and it was ok for me this time not to carry it with me. The nurse came through later and started whispering that my daughter had the common cold a few days ago and started making snide comments that we shouldn’t be at the clinic to the receptionist. I was shocked that she didn’t speak to me directly about it. I was happy to leave and reschedule but she said the doctor will see me. The nurse continued making snide comments throughout the session and started scaring my daughter who was crying uncontrollably. She was scaring my daughter away because she had a common cold. This team at this location is highly unprofessional, made me and my daughter feel extremely uncomfortable. I would have rather have had them reschedule us than make snide comments and make us feel uncomfortable. I understand due the COVID situation, they are being extra careful but they should be professional about it than do something you don’t want to do like look at my daughter and make snide comments to my 14 month old. Never again to this location due to the unprofessional staff. After the horrendous visit, over the last 1.5 years, I’ve been getting automatic updates to visit Dr levy’s office for a follow up eye visit from Weill Cornell. I cannot imagine putting my daughter through that again so no thank you."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This rating is for the staff at 212 E 69th St on November 17th 2021 visit.
