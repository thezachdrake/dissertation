Behind these unassuming doors lies a treasure trove of libations and culinary delights. Helmed by a wunderkind of a chef hailing from Europe truly Restaurant Pearl is not to be missed.  Let’s begin with their happy hour, for one thing the drinks are two for one. Yes, that’s right you read correctly two for one. I don’t know anywhere in Manhattan with such a deal and these aren’t your low-bar drinks shoved at you on the cheap. No, these are large refreshing-icy tumblers crafted with care. The passion fruit margarita really is a standout here. Not too sweet and just the right amount of tequila. Our table was only all too happy to enjoy two rounds. But, the real hit here in my opinion is the food. A generous portion of guacamole paired with our drinks with heaps of avocado seasoned to perfection and served with perfectly salty blue corn tortilla chips and radishes for those seeking a healthier crunch.  We also ordered the oysters and as an oyster aficionado I must say my mind was blown. The oysters were shucked so no slurping needed and served bathed in an Asian marinade that highlighted their brininess without disguising the salty subtlety of the sea.  Pieces of seaweed complimented the dish as we delicately spooned the joyful mouthfuls as one of our diners declared they were, “the best oysters she’s ever had.”  We also tried the tuna tartar another overplayed dish by most New Yorker’s standards, yet here once again like the oysters they were served in an ingenious way none of us had ever had. Bright-fresh red pieces of ahi perfectly cut and served in sesame cones that were quickly devoured in two bites. Unlike at other establishments there was no need for lemon or such to add for lack of seasoning by the chef. Everything here prepared by Chef George is presented with such care and attention that nothing even required so much as a salt shake.  Lastly on presentation by the generous aforementioned Chef was a dessert that sounds truly bizarre but is a symphony for the taste buds.  White soy sauce ice cream served with tiny pearls of delectable caviar.  I must say I went towards this dish with a rather trepidation-shaking like spoon, but my palette was awakened to a discovery of saltiness from the ice cream with sweet tiny traces of white chocolate finished by that delicate savoriness of caviar.  Not like anything any of us had tried before it felt like a culinary experience rivaled by Michelin star chefs at a price point that is anything but break the bank.  Should you ever find yourself roaming the cobbled stoned streets of this enchanting neighborhood I cannot recommend restaurant Pearl enough.  You’ll leave feeling as though you’ve been whisked to one of the most inventive restaurants in Europe and leave delighted, I guarantee it."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This restaurant is easily walked by whilst roaming the delightful historic South Street Seaport, but trust me you do not want to.
