I was worried a bit before we went cuz we were on a short trip and i definitely don’t want to hit the restroom a lot. Delicious and clean!!!! Love it. The egg Benedict I ordered was delicious as well. Fries came with it instead of salad that I asked for but it was so good so I still loved it. Great service, and the drinks the bartender made: tasty. I got a watermelon something (sorry can’t remember the name top of my head) and my partner got the one with pineapple. We both enjoyed.
