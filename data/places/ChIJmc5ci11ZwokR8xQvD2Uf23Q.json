We can only imagine that he would’ve been completely over the moon to have a Jiu-Jitsu school right here in his old neighborhood.\n\nHistory aside, Range Jiu-Jitsu is a great place to learn the gentle art whether you want to be a competitor, a hobbyist or just want to stay fit.\n\nEduardo, the head instructor is one of the greatest ambassadors BJJ has to offer.  You’re always greeted with a warm smile, a firm handshake and he never forgets your name.  His skill level is amongst the elite, he teaches with meticulous detail that can simplify even some of the more complex moves. He also works in his marvelous sense of humor that makes this journey all the more fun.\n\nAt 57, I started my Journey a little later in the game so my first concern of course was for my safety as in, how would a senior adult fit in working out with a school of much younger and fit students?    You will find a very friendly vibe at Range, especially to newcomers.  But the truest test of a professor is in his students.  Range students are quiet professionals who check their egos along with their shoes at the front door.\n\nBJJ is not easy. You will learn to adapt to being physically and mentally challenged; awkward, out of breath and overpowered, sometimes by smaller and weaker training partners.  But you will never be abused or humiliated.  People here respect your boundaries and move at your own pace.\n\nI highly recommend Range BJJ as it checks all the right boxes.  It’s on the ground floor, easily accessible and immaculately clean.  On the mat, there is a serious yet fun vibe.
