Beautiful salon, very eclectic and designed well. That’s why I gave it two stars.\n\nI’m sure everyone there is talented, but My haircut wasn’t good at all. My curls are coarser and tighter than I think she was used to, and she made bad judgment on telling me to come with my hair “as is” which was about 4 days old, and some stretching from wearing it up. She literally chopped at my curls in an unnatural state, and ruined my shape that I’ve been growing in for 2.5 years. She cut so much length off, and lazily styled it after to complete the cut, which resulted in more unevenness, because it wasn’t even laying right after the styling.\n\nI even reached out ahead to confirm if any hair prep was  needed for the cut and was told to still come “as is.” I should’ve trusted my own expertise, but I try to trust any artist “process”. I haven’t been able to wear it down for 3 weeks now, and won’t be able to until It grows out. The shape is awful, it’s like a bush. I gave it 3 weeks of trying different products, air drying, diffusing, before asking for a refund. It is what it is, it’ll grow back, but I def won’t go back. I’ll go back to my old stylist.\n\nShe was nice about the refund for the service, so there’s that. My hair is lowkey ruined tho. Check the photos below, what i asked for didn’t need a lot of length cut. The picture in black was maybe a day or two before her cut. It wasn’t even the shape I asked. It’s just a bad bush now.
