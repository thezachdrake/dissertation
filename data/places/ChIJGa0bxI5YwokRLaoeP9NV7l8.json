Well, that was certainly news to my ears since she had never communicated having to schedule a six-month follow-up at any point during my visit.\n\nAnyway, I booked an appointment with my new GYN to do this six-month follow-up/give a second opinion, who confirmed to me that Dr. Lily Wong indeed misdiagnosed me when she kept fixating on the \"issue\" that she thought was so especially concerning (more concerning than doing a PAP smear for the first time in 3 years! As well as performing a pelvic exam!). I asked the new GYN if in fact this issue that Dr. Lily Wong thought was so concerning was indeed something to be concerned about and she bluntly yet kindly responded, \"No.\" Additionally, the new GYN did a Pap smear and a pelvic exam without my having to prompt her to do it!\n\nI guess the silver lining, if there could actually be one, in this very subpar experience with Dr. Loly Wong is that she made me realize and see for myself how truly wonderful and amazing **other** GYNs can be in contrast!\n\nDo not recommend.
