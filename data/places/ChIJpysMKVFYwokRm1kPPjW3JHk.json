One day I was taking a walk and found the wonderful market. I went in and found alot of things that Pennsylvania doesn't have. Service was great. Place was very clean. Very affordable prices. Hot food bar. Amazing. Staff was very friendly. Cashiers were so polite and helpful. As I came to do my checkout I was greeted and was asked if I found everything I wanted. I will definitely come back to this market again."},"publishTime":"2024-02-11T04:25:28Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.764615730291496,"longitude":-73.98795031970849},"low":{"latitude":40.7619177697085,"longitude":-73.99064828029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":7,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":0,"hour":21,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":7,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":22,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":7,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":22,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":7,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":22,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":7,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":22,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":7,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":22,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":7,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":6,"hour":21,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Tuesday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Wednesday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Thursday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Friday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Saturday: 7:30 AM – 9:30 PM","Sunday: 7:30 AM – 9:30 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"731 9th Ave, New York"}
