We live in Vermont and, may I just say, it can be CHALLENGING, to get a good haircut in The Green Mountain State. So there’s that.

As in getting a style and framing her face and just losing some of all that. And, again, the stylists in Vermont were not “helpful” in making any kind of change.\n\nSo we were FINALLY going to be able to get back to NYC and I decided I would take the opportunity to take Miranda to an actual, legit salon where a stylist with knowledge, experience and skill would be able to do some “makeover” magic. But! I also needed that stylist to bring the Good Vibes and the Positive Energy to make this a GOOD experiences for Miranda. You know?\n\nBack in the 80s, when I was coming up and would sometimes get my hair done in NYC the “salon vibe” was, frankly, STRAIGHT MEAN. Like everyone was snotty and rude and mean. Probably because they were all also starving themselves in a doomed attempt to get that starved look that was ALL the craze back then. Also, of course, I have curly hair and that was just not a thing. It was never a good, fun, positive experience for me. But I’m GROWN these days and figured I could direct the whole situation as required to steer it in the right direction.\n\nI didn’t have to.

So I went online and read through descriptions and services offered and online reviews. David Ryan Salon, in the heart of Hell’s Kitchen, is a GORGEOUS spot. The interior is really just perfect. It was quiet while we were there, but also we’d brought 2 small toddlers with us. So that was just as well.\n\nWhen I booked Miranda’s appointment I chose to request a Master Stylist. Because, WHY NOT? Two things: if you’re paying a professional to do something, get the good one! Also, there is no such thing as a good, cheap haircut. That being said, Miranda’s cut and style was $130. Which, IMO, is NOT expensive for an excellent haircut from a skilled stylist.\n\nMiranda’s stylist was Madion Russo. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Madion. Not only is he EXTREMELY good at what he does. He is kind. Kindness goes A LONG way my friends. Especially when you are talking to someone about their personal appearance and, helping them to change it. Not only did he give Miranda a BEAUTIFUL haircut, he talked to her about coloring and conditioning and styling and ALL THE THINGS in such an easy, approachable way.
