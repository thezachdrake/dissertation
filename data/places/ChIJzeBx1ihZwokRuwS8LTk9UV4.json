There is just so much variety and so many things to eat! I dined at Heno Heno twice. The first time, I had ressos for a Saturday at 6 PM. They have happy hour from 5-7 daily, and it was nice that the deal applied on weekends too. We ordered a BUNCH of skewers. We each had an oyster and a shiitake skewer, and for the meats we did chicken meatball, chicken thigh, and pork rib - one in tare (sauce) and one with salt. The salt was definitely better because the tare was a bit too sweet. The salt paired with the togarashi was the perfect combination. The chicken meatball was dry but the other two were great.  We also tried chicken gizzard, and liver, which was just okay. But the best skewer we had was the chicken skin. It was hot and crispy.\n\nThe second time I visited, we had ressos for four people on a Sunday at 5:30. Since it was a rainy Sunday night, there were barely any people dining, which was nice - because they let us linger around until 8. This time for skewers, we just did the salt chicken thigh, pork rib, and chicken skin. I had been raving to my friends about the chicken skin but this time, it came out floppy. They definitely did not crisp it long enough and it was disappointing. I got to try some regular dishes this time and we shared everything family style. We had:\n\n-Grilled beef tongue - a little bland and a bit chewy\n-5 types assorted sashimi - this had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass (?), and octopus. The picture on the menu had scallops instead of octopus, and we specifically requested the scallops but it still came out with octopus, but we decided to just eat it anyway. The octopus was chewy as expected. But the rest of the fish was very buttery and fresh. I am a tuna gal but my favorite was actually the yellowtail\n-Botan ebi - very sweet and tasted fresh, especially the head\n-Shrimp tempura - this had a lot of coating on it and the coating wasn't even crispy. It was soggy. This was my least favorite of the night\n-Creamy cod roe udon - you really can't go wrong with a creamy cod roe udon dish. It was nice and saucy. This may sound weird but I ended up using some of the sauce on my skewers. It was that good\n-Salmon don - they gave a good amount of salmon\n-Yellowtail jalapeno roll - this was good except it had too much rice\n-Chestnut and sweet potato paste with matcha ice cream - this was basically a side of sweet mashed potatoes with ice cream, because it didn't have enough chestnut flavor. I'm not normally a fan of sweet potato but after I ate it together with the ice cream, it was actually pretty good\n\nGreat izakaya option in the area and I will definitely be back again."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I love izakayas.
