Love Kelly Bowman!\nMy daughter, Dorothy Lennox, age 21, is a professional dancer, performer and model and she desperately needed a professional wardrobe.  After years of only wearing dance clothes and stuff purchased at resale shops, I wanted to help her have a professional wardrobe that would span the gamut from running all over NYC to classes and auditions, to attending meet and greets to walking the red carpet.  We found Alice and Olivia on 40th Street in NYC and we found Kelly Bowman there to help us.  My daughter now has a wonderful wardrobe which travels well, is comfortable, coordinates between pieces, is timeless and, while not cheap, did not break the bank either.\n\nMy daughter needed a lot of basic pieces that would mix and match together.  She is also a frequent international traveler and she needed items that would travel well, but look put together even if hauled around in a backpack.  Kelly, the sales associate that greeted us when we first went to A&O, helped us to find the exact right pieces.  She now has a nice pair of black suede pants that she rolled up and took with her to Paris a couple of months ago for an audition.  She was able to pair those with some great turtlenecks and a timeless suede jacket for dinner,  but she also paired it with a funky zebra-striped shirt and some fun accessories for going out to a club.  She then went to the Moulin Rouge and had a fantastic little black dress that packed perfectly.   Back home, she has several fun culottes that she pairs with some nice silk shirts and some simple tops for days running around NYC.  Finally she has several dresses that are appropriate for red carpet events and performance openings.  All of her basics came from Alice and Olivia, and Kelly helped us pick it all out and helped us get items that were on sale and that would work seamlessly together.   The quality of A&O runs from good to fantastic and I expect my daughter's pieces, especially the more expensive ones, to last her for a good long time.\n\nWe will definitely be giving Alice and Olivia more business and we will also rely on Kelly to help continue to build the needed wardrobe."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Love Alice and Olivia!
