I liked that he put me appropriately in my place and I knew I had met my match.

I have met so many doctors over my life, and I really rarely have met someone as warm and caring as Dr. Garfein.\n\nThe outcome of my surgery was a success, but more surgery is needed to finish the job as he had told me would be the case.
