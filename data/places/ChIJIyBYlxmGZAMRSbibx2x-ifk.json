This is definitely not something I've gotten to experience when the star of a show hangs out and gets to know the audience before and after the show. We all really loved this part of the evening!\nAs far as the magic goes, I left the show completely blown away. I'm fairly well-versed in magic tricks, as I grew up around magic and all I have to say is after every single one of Daniel's tricks, my jaw completely dropped. Daniel does a fantastic job of keeping the audience involved and the show was very interactive with a new volunteer helping him out in every trick! I think my favorite part of the show was when he simply read my mind. That's right. Read my mind and said it out loud to the entire audience. Don't understand how that was possible but I am still thinking about it.\nOverall, this was such an awesome Saturday night experience and I would go again in a heartbeat. Perfect for a friends night, date night or even a corporate outing! I highly recommend seeing one of Daniel's shows - truly an unforgettable, authentic, must-do NYC experience! :)"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Daniel's magic show was by far one of the coolest activities I've done in New York City.
