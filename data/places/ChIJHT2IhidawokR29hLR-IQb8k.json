The quality was so much better than anything we've ever had in Florida, they aren't even worth comparing.

Service was very fast and attentive. They didn't get anything wrong in our huge order other than bringing us an extra plate of soup dumplings, which ended up being a blessing because we definitely needed more.\n\nOverall, fantastic experience!
