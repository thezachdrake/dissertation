Also filled up my tires. Did a quick look at my rims and tires. Then he told me that he was finished and he would take my bike outside. I went to pay, which was extremely low in price compare to others places i went to.  I left and my bike is brand new. I rode in Central Park from his location to 57th st and rode back to my 116th st.  Feels awesome.
