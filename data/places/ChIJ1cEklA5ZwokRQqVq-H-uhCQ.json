I wonder how long has behavior like this been occurring at this facility to other children who can't advocate for themselves. I spoke to 2 managers and they try to downplay the maltreatment my daughter was receiving here, but God forbid, if she was in my care and had bruises, I would be charged with child abuse. This place should be held accountable for what happened to my daughter. Whoever did this should be fired immediately and a police report should be filed because this is child abuse.
