I was told (with an attitude) from all 3 ladies at the front that service was poor because they were understaffed and too busy. One even told me it was the bars fault not the waiter that i didnt get the $30 drink i ordered. This was at 2pm on a Saturday and there were many empty tables and adequate waiters. Manager then comes over and gives the same busy excuse but not an apology. He comes back later to comp my drink for the poor service. For a place that advertises as \"A signature in Waldorf Astoria hotels across the globe, Peacock Alley remains the place “to see and be seen” just as it was all those years ago for Manhattan’s high society.\" This is a big miss.
