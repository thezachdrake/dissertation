I couldn’t. Then I inquired about retouching my balayage and she gave a reasonable estimate on. I loved that I knew how much the total would be first so there are no shocks in the end! She understood my need sooo well, this is the first time in 8 years in NYC that I’m 100% satisfied! She gave me a great haircut, great retouch, couldn’t have asked for more! Got water in between and was well taken care of! Definitely recommend this salon even for first timers like I was! Happy Easter! I didn’t get the proper blow dry done hence it’s not all set etc, but that’s how I like it.
