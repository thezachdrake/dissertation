Bella has been so caring and attentive - when our daughter was having issues with solids, Bella was extremely patient and gave her lots of extra attention, and even made her foods specifically that she knew she liked at home. The daycare itself is very clean and well-organized, and Bella schedules so many sensory, art, and music activities for the kids.
