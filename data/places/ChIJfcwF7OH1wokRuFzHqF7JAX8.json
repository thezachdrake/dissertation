They almost trashed my car! I am a car enthusiast who went through BMW technician training. I DIY this car from A to Z in my own shop.

They charged double for labor and parts and unnecessary diagnostic. After several months the BMW E90 high-pressure fuel pump started to die, and I started a DIY to replace it. The disassembly is 90% like for the starter motor. Here is what I found. 1) The strut tower braces were installed wrongly, mixed up. 2) They lost a top engine wire cover. 3) Almost all wire harness holders, even the rubber ones, were broken. 4) The intake manifold was extremely overtightened. 5) They bolted the main (red) cable to the starter, severely damaging the insulation. The wire was exposed. And it could DESTROY all of the electronics or cause a FIRE. 6) I found a plastic clip holder IN THE INTAKE OF THE 6th CYLINDER. I am lucky that it was too big to enter the cylinder bore. Otherwise, my engine would be TRASHED. This part is from a different location of the engine. 7) They used old bolts for the starter motor, which were already loose. This is one time bolts that lock only once and must be replaced after each disassembly. 8) They overtightened the bolts on the air filter broking the threads. 9) They broke a plastic clip and destroyed a thread on the intake duct (this part cost $160)."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Beware!!!
