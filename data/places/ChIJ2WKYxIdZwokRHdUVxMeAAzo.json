Our case was complicated because of an incorrect address that led to service cancellation. The lady who helped us took about 40 min to look up all the information while we waited outside. From my observation, people with simple issues were helped on average every 15mins. All the ladies were calm and helpful. The office was not crowded around Jun 2022. Finally back to our case and the lady who helped us gave us standard instructions to fill out some big forms. At first it was intimidating, but we were patient and the lady was patient to guide us. I was prepared with some of the information needed, but still missing a lot of info to complete the form…myself to blame and not the lady there. Fortunately she was able to retrieve my parents info from the system and reduced our paperwork. The paperwork took around 40mins and she spent another 10min to enter into the system.
