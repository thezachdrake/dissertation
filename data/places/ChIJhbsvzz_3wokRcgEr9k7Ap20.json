We were dealing with a cranky baby and, honestly, I was just as cranky from the lack of sleep. I was really on the fence about sleep training. I mean, the idea of it made me a bit nervous – I didn’t want anything too harsh for my baby girl. But then I stumbled upon Carolina’s service and thought, “Why not just see what it’s about?” So, I set up a free discovery call, and honestly, that call changed everything. Carolina was super understanding and answered all my questions. She had this responsive approach to sleep training, which felt really comforting. It wasn’t just about sticking to a rigid plan; it was about adjusting to how my baby responded each night. I decided to go for it and got the phone support package, along with a personalized sleep plan. Let me tell you, the results were mind-blowing. By the fifth night, my daughter was actually sleeping through the night. And it wasn’t a fluke – she kept at it. Her naps got longer and more peaceful too. Carolina was like this sleep wizard – always there when I had a question or needed some reassurance. Her plan wasn’t just a bunch of steps; it was a thoughtful strategy tailored to my daughter’s needs, always keeping her comfort in mind. It’s crazy how much has changed. My baby is way happier and full of energy during the day, and I finally feel human again with all the rest I’m getting. If you’re struggling with your kiddo’s sleep, I can’t recommend Carolina enough. She’s got this gentle, responsive way of sleep coaching that works wonders.
