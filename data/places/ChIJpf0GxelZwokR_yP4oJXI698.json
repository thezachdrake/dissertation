It did get thicker but no bigger. Had several inches to cover mattress on every edge. I could possibly live with that. What I can't live with is the big shark bite out of the cover. None the big ridges running the length of the topper. Feels like you are trying to sleep on someone's legs. Where is the quality control? I see other reviewers complaining about the same thing. This is headed back to the store. I know this company helps kids but they need to sell a quality product over everything. It's a real hassle to get a product, try to use it then having to haul it back.
