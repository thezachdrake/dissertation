I then called the support line and asked when I will receive the tickets. The lady asked for my confirmation number and said she was going to put me on a brief hold. I asked her if she would be quick (because at this point the game was half over) and she re assured me she would be quick and I have nothing to worry about so I said okay. She left me on hold for 45 minutes and then hung up. I then called back and waited on hold for another 30 mins and then got hung up on again. Frustrated, I dove home and figured I’d call a 3rd time for the heck of it and went right to voicemail so I went to bed. Surprisingly, when I woke up the next day, the tickets still weren't there. I had also received a text from my cell phone provider saying I have been charged 30$ for long distance calls as your agents had left me on hold for over an hour and a half which made me extremely mad.
