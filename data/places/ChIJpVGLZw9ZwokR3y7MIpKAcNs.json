Are you like me? If you are, you want help, you need excellent legal expertise that is affordable?  Now you're reading reviews hoping to strike gold.  So was I, but I don't have to look at reviews anymore.\n\nI came across Pinni Bohm several years ago when I needed a complex deed transfer that involved the New York Courts and the New Jersey Courts.  It's too much to list everything Pinni accomplished in order to secure the transfer of the deed in my name.  But he walked us through and made it happen and we're thrilled.\n\nI did find Pinni by reading reviews and reading bios.  He was the fifth attorney I spoke to from my top ten list of candidates.  Anyone of the first four seemed to be good enough for what I wanted.  But when I called up Pinni, and we were two minutes into a conversation, I knew my search had ended.  I leaned back in my chair and knew he was the attorney I wanted to represent me..\n\nI explained what I wanted and he went through the steps we needed to take, quite clearly and patiently.  He stated up front what his fee was and what the court fees would be.\n\nAgain, I found Pinni by going through all the reviews about him and I can honestly say that all the reviews (I haven't seen any negative reviews) are 100% spot on.  So you go ahead and read them because I agree with all of it.  That is my glowing review.\n\nHis satisfied clients have used up most of the adjectives to describe his professional approach; his knowledge; his expertise of the law; his ethics and his manners.  Yes, he's polite and he's respectful.  Pinni Bohm is a fair and honest man.\n\nAnd not to forget Pinni's colleague, Tzippy, she sat with us while we went over the particulars of the Trust, oversaw additions and stayed in touch to make sure we were satisfied with the way estate planning was carried out.  As you would guess, she seems to possess all of the qualities of Pinni Bohm.\n\nOh, I almost forgot to tell you what Pinni did for me and my family this time around.  He created a Revocable Trust; a Pour-Over Will; and an excellent Power of Attorney.  We've been procrastinating for a long time but we finally got it done and Pinni he did us proud.\n\nSometimes these things can be overwhelming, and so avoid getting it done.  And that is why we are grateful we had Pinni to steer us back on course, reassure us and remind us not to sweat the small things.  It worked out well.\n\nI hope my simple review moves you to get in touch with Pinni.  Like I said several years ago in my first review, 'If it's important to you; if what you're looking for is to be happy with your decision when choosing someone to represent you, someone who'll have your back, you owe it to yourself to speak with Pinni before your make your final decision.'\n\nA good lawyer will get the job done for you, a great lawyer will get the job done and you'll learn something from them, an exceptional lawyer will achieve the result, you'll learn something from them and you'll consider yourself fortunate to have them on you side.\n\nPinni Bohm = Mission Accomplished."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Confirmation of Consistently Demonstrated Expertise and Decency\n\nHello.
