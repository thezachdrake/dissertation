The homework is the same load as a public school, i know this because i had my older son in Public school 2 blocks down from success and that how i know the comparison. What i love of success is that the communication with teachers is widely open and all staff is there to answer questions about your child. I have heard parents complain that success asks too much but i think those parents need to see if their child can keep up with success model of learning. Its not for everyone. My daughter was at risk of repeating grade because she was a reading level behind! (In DOE public school they would have passed her, again i know this because this was the situation with my son). I worked hard with her at home and at school she was given extra support in smaller groups and one on one time. Success also takes on time arrival serious. I have been late many times and they will call you out for it, but again its my responsibility to get my child on time.  Yes things happen they understand but i was late more then 20 times lol so shame on me. Overall, the school is great. They strive to make your child succeed and make sure that your child is working to their fullest potential! Its not for every child so as a parent be always involved in your child's education"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The school is great!
