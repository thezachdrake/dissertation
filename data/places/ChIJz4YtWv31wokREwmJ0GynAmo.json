You can see in the pics. I ended up having to remove my polish and repaint my own nails with colors I have. If I go again it will be only to do pedicure because the treatment for that was worth it and my toes still look good. I’ll save myself money.\n\nI was skeptical on trying this place out because of all the negative reviews. Then I decided this week that I didn’t feel like going to my regular spot and needed something new pedicure and manicure experience-wise. I saw this spot had a site to make appointments with, which I loved. I got there early but once the owner noticed me she let me in within 5 minutes and started preparing my order (I got the pink crystal pedicure and regular manicure). Chose my colors, and I was seated quickly. A lady named Ericka took care of me after the owner set up the water.\n\nI had to tell the owner how beautiful her spot was because it really is, but she doesn’t seem to be the type to enjoy conversing much (very serious and almost cold..).\n\nEricka, on the other hand, was very sweet. This Pink crystal treatment was AMAZING. She put a mask on my legs, scrubbed my feet so well, making sure to get a lot of my dead skin off, and when fixing my nails made no negative comments - just did her duty and did it very gently! (I’m used to so many nail techs making comments on how short my toe nails are..which over time gets annoying…I am not paying you to comment on length).\n\nEricka also massaged my legs and feet and she took her time with the treatment. My toe nails came out beautiful.\n\nNow, the only reason I give 4 stars is because of my experience with the manicure. Ericka was the one who started preparing my hands. I assumed at first she would be the one to finish off everything, but suddenly she asked me to move to another table where a young man ended up being the one taking care of me. First I was confused but then I realized more people were coming in and Ericka was taking over another customer.\n\nThe young man looked new to everything. They thought I only spoke English but I understood everything they said. I noticed the young man didn’t even know the difference of base coat and top coat and asked what to do. He also forgot to lotion my hands properly before the nail prep and then when painting my nails I had to tell him to do another coat because the color was off and didn’t look the way I wanted it to. He was nice, he just seemed to be a beginner and I would have preferred Ericka’s work on my hands.\n\nIt appears it’s a family run business though, so I understand if that may be a brother, nephew, or even son trying to learn the business to earn some coins. It’s also HIGHLY rare to see men doing nails, so I’m happy they’re breaking that barrier.\n\nIn the end I was satisfied with my experience.
