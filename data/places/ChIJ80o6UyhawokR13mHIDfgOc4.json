I had already been out of the store for about 15 minutes, but when I returned they were kind, trusting, and gave me a new product without question. They know their stuff, and they were aware that the product was defunct since it did not omit a light, which a puff bar will do whether it is dead or not (it blinks to indicate when the product has run out).
