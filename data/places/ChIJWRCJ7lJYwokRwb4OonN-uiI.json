('DD\") at Big Apple around noon.  The first thing I noticed was that the music was extraordinarily loud for a grocery store and was pretty sure there had to be a speaker right next to the DD.  Upon arriving at the counter, a tall young man behind the counter came over and asked me what I would like.  So, I told him, in a voice which was as loud as I could speak without yelling, that I wanted a ham and Swiss cheese sandwich and pointed to the pre-made ham sandwiches in the glass case.\nThe next thing I knew, he was over at the slicing machine slicing a block of Swiss cheese.  So I asked him \"what are you doing?\"  He said, \"you wanted Swiss cheese didn't you?\"  I answered \"Yes, but I just want it on my ham sandwich and again, I pointed to the pre-made sandwiches. (There was a shorter clerk right there in front of me, who I am sure can confirm what I said to this fellow who was cutting the Swiss.)\nThe tall fellow then came over to the counter and hands over a package of Swiss wrapped in plastic.  (I would like to point out at this time that the clerk never asked me how much Swiss I wanted -- 1/2 lb., a pound, etc., he just cut what he presumed I wanted.)  Well, I told him \"I never ordered Swiss cheese (by itself), that I had in fact, ordered a ham and Swiss cheese sandwich two times.  And that was when the big shouting match started.\nThen the supervisor of the DD came over and said \"nobody yells at my employees.\"  I then told him that if he didn't have that music blasting so loudly maybe his employees could hear me and get my order correctly.  And I reiterated this statement a couple of times so that he would get the point.\nI would also like to point out at this time that I have had a problem with this supervisor in the past.  He says \"next\" to the next customer, who happened to be me, and then instead of taking my order, he goes over to the slicing machine and starts cleaning it off from the previous customer's order.  And it is only after that that he comes over to you and is ready to take your order.  At that time I said, \"are you ready to take my order now?\"  He got sarcastic and said \"well, I have to clean the machine first you know.\"  I didn't argue with him at the time, as I felt I would just be wasting my time.  That this guy was never going to change.  (I know there was another man that was very angry with this supervisor for what I am sure was the same reason.)\nNeedless to say, we got Into a big shouting match, and I was really surprised that the store manager didn't show up.  And this supervisor told me \"don't bother coming back.\"  Yes, there was a misunderstanding, however, I am fairly sure this whole thing could have been prevented if they would turn that music off or at the least put it down a whole lot more so that the clerks can hear people.  I don't have a loud voice, but I really don't feel that 1) I should have to yell in order to be heard by DD staff because the music is so loud.  2) I think that the clerk I was dealing with needs to pay better attention to what a person is saying to him, and 3) I believe that the supervisor needs an adjustment to the way he takes an order.  Why should a customer have to wait while he cleans the slicer before it takes your order?  You don't see them doing that in the banks, do you?  Personally, I believe it might helpful if the DD was monitored via a video camera, with audio, for a while.
