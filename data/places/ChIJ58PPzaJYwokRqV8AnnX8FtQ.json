Her bedside manner was excellent, comparable to the level of care I received from another amazing PA-C here who I’ve seen several times before, Nicole Kopchak. I felt listened to and heard, and Christine was probably in the room with me for at least half an hour, taking her time explaining the anomalies and the plan and providing me as much comfort as anyone can in a scary situation. They redid my bloodwork immediately, expedited it because of the possibility of serious illness and called me as promised the next morning with what turned out to be good news. I’ve been with WFM for 3 or so years now and I have never felt like my health was in better hands. They’ll really hear you at WFM and they’ll find a way to get you in pronto if you need to be seen; telemedicine appointments are also a breeze to schedule and I can usually get one within a couple hours of calling. They practice preventative care, and check for problems before it’s too late. They treat the whole you. The practitioners and nurses here actually care, and they treat you like a whole person, rather than just a dollar amount. Forever recommending this practice."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I just have to say, I had a really scary thing happen to me after I got some bloodwork done, it looked like I might have leukemia or bone marrow cancer.
