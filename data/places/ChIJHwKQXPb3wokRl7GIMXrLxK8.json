I can’t speak to the chicken (she liked it) but the chana saag was very tasty and a perfect texture (not soupy or watered down and the chick peas were nice and firm). The tali lunch specials come with a generous portion of basmati rice, delicious yellow dal (nice and garlicky), a delicious mixed vegetable (carrots, peas, green beans, and lots of vibrant spices), and warm naan. The naan contains dairy (eggs and milk in the batter) so I didn’t eat that but it smelled great and was warm and fluffy. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoyed Indian food or simply flavorful food in general.
