My wife jumped in the driver side and I done a quick lap of the car to inspect. Immediately I saw a light scuff on the pax front door and a straight, longer scratch on the upper hood pax side. I did the usual light dry finger rub then wet my finger to remove. Neither removed the marks. I then asked the attendant why my car was scratched. At this point he explodes into a fit of rage, (as previously mentioned in comments). The conversation then had absolutely no substance because this guy was just irrational.
