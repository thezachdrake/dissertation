The handouts were very helpful and included virtually all that we needed to know to successfully complete the cleanse.  One of the things that stood out to me was the gentle way Deborah met each of us right where we were in regard to food without making any of us feel uncomfortable.

Highly recommend this if you are looking to \"kick start\" your well being and healthy lifestyle."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I just finished a 10 day cleanse with Deborah and a wonderful group of women.
