The yoga sessions are run by different yoga companies and the one I attended was by Sputnik Yoga and was a silent headphone yoga session.  We each were provided, free of charge, headphones to wear during class.  This was my first time attending a session like this but had a blast!  It was quite a workout and I was sweaty by the end.\n\nOverlook offers other types of activities like Meditation, Ribbon Dancing, Barre classes and Story time for kids.

I highly recommend trying them out."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Overlook is located in Bryant Park and is on the 2nd floor of the observation deck of the skating pavilion.
