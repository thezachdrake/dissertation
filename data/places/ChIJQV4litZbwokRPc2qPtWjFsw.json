The service was good but one of the servers kept coming back to try and take our plates away when we were clearly still eating! The food was good, but for the prices could have been better. We got the sausage and it wasquite tough to chew. Meatballs were amazing! The shrimp in sauce was good and the crab cake was fresh and good, a little bland though. Fantastic cocktails! Would I come back? Maybe for the lunch deal but not dinner again."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Important: They automatically add 30% gratuity to the check, regardless of the party size.
