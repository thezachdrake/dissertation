For the steep price I pay in rent, I would expect to get good service, or at least for management to care -- even just a little -- about their tenants, but NO. Glenwood is the WORST landlord I've ever had.\n\nAbsolutely everyone is awful --and every Glenwood building is the same-- because the orders come from head office, but of course tenants aren't allowed to actually speak to the people making the orders/decisions. So the people in the building have no accountability and take no responsibility. Here are just a few of the many issues with Glenwood management:\n\n1. Rents are expensive, and you can expect them to get hiked up each year with little to no negotiating power.  The prices should be based on the market value, not just hiked up the max percentage allowed by law each year automatically.\n\n2. The package room is constantly (I mean, every couple of weeks) losing my packages with no explanation. The package room guys are seriously unmotivated and lazy (with zero customer service skills), and don't log packages in, or hide expensive ones in the hopes that tenants won't notice them missing and they can then steal them a few days later. Not to mention that when I call to have packages brought up to my apartment, 80% of the time they forget (they don't write it down anywhere) and I have to keep calling, and the rest of the time it takes them hours.\n\n3. Complain to management and you'll end up following up six times, with them saying they'll get back to me and never doing that, before finally giving up. There's ZERO accountability. I honestly don't even think they write things down, let alone keep track of the issues tenants call about. Without a tracking system, there's no reason for management or the repairs/handyman staff to follow up, or even keep track of issues. No accountability.\n\n4. If you have an issue with a neighbor, even if they're breaking the law, they tell you to call the cops or, basically, shut up. They will not help you, and there's nobody to complain to about the service you get, because the owners of Glenwood care so little about their tenants that they made sure it's impossible to find out who they are (go ahead - dig around on the web -- they are invisible), let alone how to contact them. Therefore, no accountability. Therefore, no improvement in service.\n\n5. The workers in the building simply don't show up when you have an appointment, so you have to call on average three to six times, sometimes more, to get something fixed.\n\n6. The hallways are not kept up. The Glenwood workers scrape, mark up and rip the wallpaper in the hallway while transporting their handyman carts, and of course that never gets repaired, so the hallways end up looking beat up.\n\n7. The Glenwood sales rep that rents out the apartments lied to me. He said that the apartment was cable-ready and showed me these things on the wall that looked like they were for cable. I had Time Warner AND Verizon Fios come over, and they both said that those were from the 1960's or thereabouts and have no use. In order to have cable you have to staple the cords along your ceiling. I asked my neighbors about this, and they said the same thing. He also told me that heat and AC is paid for by Glenwood -- that's a half-truth because they're electricity-powered and the tenant pays for electricity. My electrical bills, for a one-bedroom, are about $350/month.\n\n8. And this one is least important, but the heater/AC units are totally useless. They are basically either on or off, and you're either super hot or super cold. You can't adjust them properly like ones in newer buildings. These are from the 1960's and they don't seem to see a need to replace them.\n\nThey really need to shape up and start acting like they care about their tenants, and figure out a system where there's some accountability, or they're going to get an even worse rep and lose tenants."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am a tenant of Glenwood Management Corporation.
