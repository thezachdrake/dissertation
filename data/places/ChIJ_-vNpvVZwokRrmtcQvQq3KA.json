Of course I can’t stay without buying anything so like clockwork I would get an oat or matcha latte with food, either salad or some pastries. It’s quite convenient for me to stay here but I have yet to get good service here. Today, Sunday at 9:48am, I ordered a matcha latte. I specifically asked for a regular cup because I’m going to sit here. Barista says sure. Of course I gave a 20% tip coz they flip that iPad infront of u before they even do anything for you. Did I get my regular cup that I requested? Nope!  And this isn’t the first time. This has happened over and over and over. I asked the barista why she didn’t give me what I asked for she goes oh I didn’t hear you.  She actually asked me specifically if I was staying to which I responded yes. This is normally not a big deal but come on, listen. I am always expected to give tip but I can never expect customer service.
