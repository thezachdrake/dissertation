Let me say that again. This was the best matcha latte I’ve had in my entire life. The matcha flavor was amazing and the sweetness level was literally perfect.

I still think about this latte from time to time, crushed by the fact that thousands of miles separate us.\n\nThe anmitsu was also extreme tasty. The hojicha ice cream paired well with the chewy mochi, crystal jelly, and sugar syrup. I’m not sure what the maple leaf was but it was chewy and had a very mild flavor that I didn’t particular like but didn’t mind.\n\nThe rosemary orange tea was quite interesting.\n\nI only had a bite of the sweet yam dango but the mochi texture was amazing and had a perfect sweetness level.\n\nI did not try the salmon box but was told it was also amazing.\n\nOverall I was extremely satisfied with my visit to Cha-An. The flavors of everything were amazing and it has earned them a spot in my must-try NYC list. My only complaint is that the prices are fairly expensive, even for NYC standards. At the time of our visit the hot matcha latte was $15 and the anmitsu was nearly $20 for that little cup of dessert.
