Janet did an amazing job, and i’m grateful for her taking me in and the other braiders that helped out to finish with my hair. The issue is I originally booked with Dao, and we agreed on a time and day (I was crossing over from new jersey). As I was on my way- she texted me and pushed me back 30 minutes. I said no problem. I stalled and was there 15 minutes before the time she wanted me there and I said cool- i’ll wait inside and texted her to let me know when she arrived. She said okay. I went in and a lady asked me who am I here for and I responded with “Dao, but i’ll sit and wait for her as she’s on her way”. The lady told me she was in the back on her chair. Confused, I walked to her area, and she was braiding a lady already. This frustrated me because she lied to me and told me she was late; she pushed me back 30 minutes knowing I was crossing from New Jersey; and she made me sit and wait for her even when we agreed on a time that she did not respect. A half hour later, Janet came by and braided me instead. Which- bless her because if somebody didn’t start working on my hair in the next 5 minutes, I would’ve left. I was there for what seemed like an eternity. I was there for 9 and a half hours for small butt length knotless braids. They also played very loud religious music, so if you aren’t really into that - i suggest you bring headphones.
