I don't even know who my current super is. Furthermore, the super rarely responds to inquiries. I have to spam text just to find out he has read my message.\n- Old notices are not taken down soon enough in elevators or lobby bulletins. It is apparent that there isn't staff that regularly checks the well being of the building/tenants.\n- Repairs are announced too soon, giving tenants little to no time to prepare. They tape notices on our apartment doors informing you of boiler repairs that state it will happen \"tomorrow\", when in reality they put it on your door the same morning of the repair.

The hallway reeks of those nasty substances sometimes when I walk out of the elevator to my apartment.\n- Half of the machines in the laundry room are not working properly. The machines shake violently when in use, and the laundry machines leak water in the back attracting mosquitoes and forming mold. Especially when the weather is warmer, the lobby hallway and laundry room are homes to these pests. Dryer machines are missing handles, and don't even dry!\n- The water used to mop the floors in the morning is smelly. No, I am not referring to the chemicals using in the water solution. The mop water being used smells old and dirty. Please do not reuse mop water from previous days, or kindly clean the mop once in awhile.\n- The office employers who work on the first floor of the building clearly do not enjoy their jobs.
