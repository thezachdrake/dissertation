It's unlike no other and is worth coming to see. I also know that even the best places have off nights and it happens.\n\nThe evening started really well at first. The cheese plate is very good and the drinks are well made. But as the place got busier the quality and service went downhill fast!\nThrough the night we saw our waitress less and less. The risotto tasted like a box of salt got dropped in it on the way out here. It was horrible. Which was such a bummer because I LOVE risotto. The waitress quickly just asked what I wanted instead and nothing else. After eating so much salt in a few bites it was hard to want to eat anything else. The chicken was VERY good though and I highly recommend it.\n\nAfter that we didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes. The host came and we asked for another drink. It was a special occasion and we wanted to order desert but by then we hadn't seen our waitress for so long we thought forget it....\n\n35 minutes of waiting for the check we just walked up and stood at the bar for our check...let me say we sat down at 5pm and didn't leave until 8:20... The waitress then said she was going to bring us desert but...we will never know...last, best part the elevators didn't work. It stopped at the 45th floor and went no further....when you're at the 65th floor this is not a good feeling. None the less we made it to the bottom after going to a different elevator.\n\nA few takeaways, if you're celebrating something special just stop for a drink and move on to a more intimate place. The tables with a good view are on top of each other. It's New York, there are much better suited places to celebrate. Also it doesn't matter which evening you go, it will be busy and the service will be slow.\n\nI'm sure it isn't always like this but this was my experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"To say this place was a disappointment would be an understatement...and although I never have given a place 1 star, this time it was earned.\n\nLet me start with saying the views are incredible and unbeatable here.
