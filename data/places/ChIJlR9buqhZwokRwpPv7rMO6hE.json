I was dead wrong!!! They are great!!! Sure we had a learning curve and we had to learn what the other wanted but they have been super nice and the work is really nice and fits really well. Much of it may be due to the Itero but I love the consistency and the customer service. I don't know who the other dentists are referring too but I have never dealt with any unpleasant people there and whenever I need help with a complicated case they always direct me to the right person. Do we have the occasional hiccup, sure  we do, like all doctor- lab relationships. But one call and its resolved. I did have the occasional delivery issue as another doctor mentioned but that's not the lab. Can't blame Amazon if UPS screws up the delivery. But they handled it fast and with no drama. I deal with Danny (the manager) a lot and we have a great relationship. I'm not afraid to tell him that something is not to my liking and he is not afraid to tell me that my prep needs work. I value that type of relationship and even when this promotion is over (in a few months), there is no reason for me to switch labs. They are on top of their game in terms of tech and they deliver really nice work from anterior crowns to implants to removable. Very pleased and see myself with them for many years to come."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I started using this lab 2 years when they had an Itero promotion.
