They dove in to the project with unbounded enthusiasm and brought some really great ideas to the table. Working with my event management firm, they designed a menu which was wholly befitting of our audience (designers, architects, etc.). Taking our event flow into mind, they actually conceived of different stations which expertly extended to space and ensured that traffic steadily flowed to all parts of the showroom as opposed to having folks congregating around one or two stations. When it came to the day of the events, the Personal Touch team was passionate and laser-focused on ensuring our event attendees had amazing food and top-notch service as they toured and enjoyed the space. The Personal Touch team was outstandingly professional and accommodating at every turn. Example 1: One of our guests requested a specific brand of liquor and a member of team went out and got it especially for them. Example 2: A coworker asked if one of the items being butlered was available: that and more was promptly brought to where they were standing just a few short moments later. The amazing presentation, quality of personalized service and all-around wonderful food was all that we could have asked for and more.
