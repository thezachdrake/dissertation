I will never step back there again and I don’t advise anyone to.   I am fair with both opinions and I do believe last impressions lasts forever because that’s the true experience. Also they will keep on sending you crazy amount of emails and texts reminding you of some survey and thanking of your visits 3 times a day and schedule imaginary virtual calls that never happened or informed about obviously to collect money out of your insurance.
