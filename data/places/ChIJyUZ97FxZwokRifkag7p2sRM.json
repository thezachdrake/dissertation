Should've mentioned that before I paid, right?Tried to talk to them about it, but they blamed it on one missing employee. Seriously? There were eight others there who could've given me a heads up. On top of that, I saw some sketchy hygiene stuff—no gloves while handling food, and they were goofing around, hugging and having lengthy conversations. It was super unprofessional, no type of control by a manager or anything. Finally got my order, and it was a major letdown. Dry chicken, tiny portions. After a long day, I was just looking forward to a decent meal, but Wingstop managed to disappoint on every level. Wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone. The customer service was unprofessional and off, the wait was painful, and the food quality was a joke."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Had a pretty disappointing time at Wingstop today.
