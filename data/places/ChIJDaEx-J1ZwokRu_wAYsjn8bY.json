Like the healthy food policy , we aren't allowed to eat chips nor candy at school and we're limited to beverages such as 100% juice, water and milk. I just feel like they should be a little more flexible with that rule. Another thing would be that the kids there are just .... dramatic. They cause drama upon themselves and others.

As a parent whose child has been enrolled since kindergarten, I have found the administration and faculty to be willing to listen to my concerns and achieve a compromise which benefits all parties, but most importantly- the student. Girls Prep now offers regents coursework for 8th graders in math and science. This gives scholars a competitive advantage- preparing and allowing them to earn admission to the city's most selective public, private, and independent high schools. But the school cannot do it alone. Girls Prep has expectations for its students where accountability is key. Much like college, teachers have office hours several times a week where students can get clarification on a topic or support if they are not performing well. Girls Prep lives up to its mission of preparing girls for college and beyond. So why only 4 stars?
