It's difficult enough dealing with endometriosis but even more difficult when you feel as though you can't trust your medical team.\n\nI was very happy with my initial visit to Dr. Boz's office. I loved the small stylish office and Dr. Boz's small staff (2 front facing personnel) gave a very chic boutique feel. I've never dealt with any serious medical illnesses, thank God so I knew I wanted to find a small office where I would receive a lot of care and attention. Initially, I thought this was the place for me.\n\nSheila (staff member) was often out of the office and apparently was the only one I could speak with regarding insurance questions. This was an issue. I was originally scheduled for surgery in August but was told that an authorization form was needed in order for my insurance to cover the hefty cost. Dr. Boz is an out of network doctor.\n\nDr. Boz and his staff members constantly reiterated the fact that he is an out of network doctor but if an authorization form is put in with your insurance for the procedure and approved then you will receive reinbursement once your insurance has paid the doctor. Well after the surgery was done and I paid (out of pocket) just 2 days before the surgery, I found out that an authorization was only put in for the hospital facilities and anesthesiologist and not the procedure from the doctor at all. I felt so mislead. I also did not appreciate the amount of stress I was under when finding out that I had to pay a large sum of money just 2 days before my surgery. I am a teacher and had already submitted for my time off with prepared lesson plans. I had to pay even though I thought my \"approved\" authorization form took care of everything. I did not like finding out that this was not the case just days before my surgery. I also did not appreciate getting a call on a Friday afternoon to get blood work and an MRI done before Monday. Even if they did need this work done closer to the date of my surgery, I would have appreciated more heads up notice so that I did not have to scramble and move things around in my schedule to make it work.  (They later found out that I didn't actually need the MRI once double checking my age). The staff was very unorganized.\n\nI simply do not want anyone else to feel deceived.\n\nNote: You will be asked to leave a review. My husband came with me to all of my visits (including my follow up visit post surgery). At this appointment, we were asked to leave a review. We were asked to leave a 5 star review right there in his office. He wanted to see the review before we left. We felt pressured. I made my review but apparently it did not post in a speedy manner and then my husband was asked to leave a review. It was forced.\n\nJust wanted to make folks aware of this. I know I rely heavily on reviews before trying out a new establishment.\n\nDr. Boz was a great doctor - he checked in multiple times post surgery. His office (staff) needs a lot of attention on their  organization. I would have also preferred if the doctor did not discuss money with the patient (me) directly - this was weird."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Incredibly disappointed with my experience at Dr. Boz's office.
