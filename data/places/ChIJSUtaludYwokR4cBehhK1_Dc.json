I got back to the car around 8:00PM and as I got my car i was getting settled when the valet drove behind and honked me out the way so I drove off. When i got home I searched for the money and could not find it. I called them and a man picked up and claim he did not speak English and that I would have to call back in the morning for someone who did and hung up and did not pick up any further calls. I called spothero (according to their policy they are not responsible) and they tried to call, only to have them hang up without speaking to them about they heard the issue. You pay for service not thinking that your privacy and belongs would be violated. You entrust your hard earned investment....this is not what you expect.
