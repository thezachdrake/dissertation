The mussels were perfectly cooked, tender, and bathed in a flavorful broth that made every bite a delight. The oysters were incredibly fresh and served on a bed of ice, accentuating their natural brininess. As for the butterfly shrimp, they were crispy, succulent, and accompanied by a delectable dipping sauce that complemented their delicate flavors perfectly.\n\nThroughout my meal, the service remained amazing. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were more than happy to answer any questions I had and ensured that I had everything I needed to thoroughly enjoy my dining experience.\n\nLeaving \"The Shell\", I couldn't help but feel utterly satisfied and grateful for such a remarkable culinary adventure.
