The office was disorganized, there were confidential calls being made to patients in front of me in the waiting room, I was left sitting for over a half an hour with no one addressing my presence or updating me on how much later my appointment would be. When I finally was seen, the Dr. was rude, abrasive, judgmental, and refused to listen to me when I answered questions. I went in for a routine annual exam; informed her I was still recovering from a serious Kidney infection, and mentioned my abdomen was still sore from it. She immediately told me she wanted me to go to a hospital for a bunch of scans and tests to rule out ectopic pregnancy, even when I explained there was no way I was any kind of pregnant (I had not been sexually active in months and the pregnancy test she gave me was negative). She drew blood for \"a more accurate pregnancy test\", but then also had it tested for a litany of other things she did not inform me about and I was stuck with that lab bill.  She called me \"chubby\" 3 times in the 25 minutes she spent with me, and not in reference to a concern with my cholesterol (perfect), blood pressure (perfect), or reproductive health (not addressed in any way). She told me I was \"too chubby\" for my age when I first sat down (pretty sure that is NOT how you determine how much someone should weigh, but for argument's sake I am 32), she actually marveled at my overall physical health given how \"chubby\" I am, and then she informed me that I was \"too chubby\" for her to perform a routine exam accurately (I am 5'6\" 180lbs...not winning any swimsuit competitions, but certainly not too heavy to perform a pap smear. I can actually confidently say my vagina is the least chubby part of my body!) and recommended I see a specialist instead...but still billed my insurance for the visit. She then called me a few days later to tell me I was not pregnant (mmhmm, I told her that. So did the pregnancy test.), and that I had elevated white blood cell counts which meant I was fighting and infection (yeah, I know. In my Kidney. I told her that too). She then asked when I would be coming back to see her and \"follow up\", and got aggressively defensive when I informed her I would be seeking treatment from a provider I felt more comfortable with. When she asked why I was uncomfortable, I listed all the concerns above and the only thing she said was \"well dear, you ARE chubby\". I then received several calls from her and her receptionist asking me to give them my credit card number for an additional $15 co-pay. I asked every time that they email me a bill, and spelled out my email every single time, and never received a bill but received calls requesting payment for months. I have NOTHING positive to say about this practice, or anyone who is a part of it.
