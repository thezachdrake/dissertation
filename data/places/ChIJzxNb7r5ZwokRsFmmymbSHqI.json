That has never been more apparent than at 3 Eleven, where failures ruin a property that has great potential.\n\nBelow is a summary of problems since moving in as an early tenant; there are too many to mention. It boils down to management not caring about anything once you’ve signed a lease. They handle resident problems by gaslighting, denying, ignoring. When they do respond, it’s with contempt and attitude. Further, the mgmt outsources all possible functions - security, amenities management, package handling, etc.- to third parties to avoid responsibility for anything.\n\nYou will wonder why you are paying some of the highest rent per sqft in Manhattan to live somewhere with Spirit Airlines-level service and high school kids staffing the building (see #3, 4 below).\n\nSummary of issues:\n1. The Diddling Doorman: I came home around 1 am on a weekend night to find the doorman in the middle of an…intimate act… with a woman at the front desk. I was shocked at this level of unprofessionalism, and raised the incident to Clinton Management’s exec leadership. They claimed an investigation found nothing on security cameras, even though I provided the date/time, and blamed it on “likely a temp worker” from their outsourced security contractor.\n\n2. Poor Security: Front doors are unlocked 24/7 including nights. Other door-manned buildings in the area use fob readers at night as an extra security measure. There’s only one front desk attendant at a time and they are sometimes “preoccupied”. I urged management to consider extra security at night e.g. using fob readers already built into elevator panels. They refused stating “we leave all of our buildings unlocked at night” as if this is valid justification for lax security.\n\n3. Understaffing, with Children: Some staff, incl. package room and amenities floor, are young high school students. Worse yet, they are understaffing these positions. For a building with ~1,000 units, they have one single attendant sorting all deliveries and handling resident pickups. It feels almost exploitative to them, and leads to delays over a day to sort after delivery. Sometimes they are so backed up, mountains of boxes overflow into the lobby.\n\n4. Bait & Switch Amenities: As other reviewers have noted, amenities are a huge selling point of this property but good luck using them. Mgmt frequently closes the amenity floor for their own private/external events even though tenants pay an extra $150/person/mo membership fee.   They also frequently change rules about which amenities your membership includes, and add have added add'l fees for some that were included when the amenities contract was signed. Amenities floor staff are high school kids and not clear on their own rules. Blatant bait and switch practices.\n\n5. Foul Gym Odor, Broken Equipment: The gym has a bad smell (perhaps from the adjacent trash room or sewage back up?) and several broken pieces of equipment. There are broken weight machines, and malfunctioning treadmills that stop abruptly mid run, and a giant shattered glass panel which hasn't been fixed in months. Management gives lip service - “we’re actively engaged as a team to fix these problems”.\n\n6. Drafty Windows in Winter: On winter days, prepare for your apartment to be 25-35ºF colder near windows vs. the rest of the room. Management brought contractors in to inspect the windows but not until the weather warmed up. After banging on the window frames with the back of screwdrivers and small mallets, the contractors found “no problem”.\n\n7. Attitude Towards Residents: Last but not least, concerns sent to the building management are dismissed with attitude, a passive aggressive flyer, or ignored with no response. It’s clear they have no interest in helping once the lease is signed.\n\nThere are a lot of other buildings in this area managed by companies that actually know how to run a luxury building.

The grills don’t really work unless you bring your own ignition sources. You want to dry your hands after using the restroom, hopefully there are paper towels, and even if there are, it’s not like they bathrooms are really cleaned well. You want a table inside the amenity space to sit at, hopefully you don’t have to wipe stale dried on beer off of two different tables just to have a place to sit with friends.\n\nThe construction of the building itself is kind of shockingly poor, hopefully you get windows that you can open without being worried that they will never shut again.

It’s like going to the USPS office on a holiday. Typically understaffed, takes forever, and generally just doesn’t care. If they can’t locate your packages in a few minutes they will just say they are lost and to come back later. And having business hours for a building package room when the desk is staffed 24 hrs a day seems like a complete joke. Why wouldn’t the front desk be able to help grab packages like every other NYC building? It would be way better than waiting over 40 minutes to pick up a package, because I have, and I wasn’t even at the back of the line.\n\nAnd then there is the lack of communication outside of the amenity events. The building can’t give timely notices if any on things that are happening, for instance the entire building smells like floor wax or paint thinner for going on a week because of a new ground floor tenant and the building has said absolutely nothing. The fact that people’s apartments 50 floors up smell so badly of fumes is an absolute failure on the building.

The amount of showers that I have had to take where I end up shivering during my shower is crazy for a so called “luxury” building. Most mornings luke warm is about the best you can expect.\n\nI really wish that they management company cared even the slightest because this building has so much potential, but it’s clear that this was a building that they bought to extract every dollar they could while providing the appearance of being a fancy building.\n\nAnd the very last point is security because some people like that type of thing. If you do, find somewhere else to live. Anyone can come and go as they please, nobody has to check in with the front desk.\n\nIt really is like the management company just did the absolute least they could do on every single aspect of the building.

They market it as a safety feature saying the showers and tubs only get water that is heated to a certain temperature so you can’t burn yourself, in reality they should say that they don’t want to pay to heat the water so that they can cut costs. The amount of showers that I have had to take where I end up shivering during my shower is crazy for a so called “luxury” building. Most mornings luke warm is about the best you can expect.\n\nI really wish that they management company cared even the slightest because this building has so much potential, but it’s clear that this was a building that they bought to extract every dollar they could while providing the appearance of being a fancy building.\n\nAnd the very last point is security because some people like that type of thing. If you do, find somewhere else to live. Anyone can come and go as they please, nobody has to check in with the front desk.\n\nIt really is like the management company just did the absolute least they could do on every single aspect of the building. You are paying for location and the illusion of a luxurious experience.\n\nHopefully the management decides to actually get invested one of these days, but they will need to make serious investments for them to fix the reputation that they decided to build."},"publishTime":"2024-02-02T05:21:16Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJzxNb7r5ZwokRsFmmymbSHqI/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaLVpTVC13RRAB","rating":4,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL9IzATtcyC8zHU6WIY80UR_k2bFEwQJYWmkToqm4kd=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116583997925937800803/reviews","displayName":"Amy Gellatly"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Overall I absolutely love living here.
