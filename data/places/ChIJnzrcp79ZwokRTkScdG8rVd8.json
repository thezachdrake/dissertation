I loved the vinaigrette: punchy, almost fruity, well-seasoned. However, everything just didn’t come together as a salad. The chips were awkwardly large and flavorless, the chunks of tomato were also unwieldy and mostly watery, and there just wasn’t enough dressing or salt to hold up to all the water gushing out from the lettuce.
