Which didn’t make sense because we were there to find out what was needed from us. He judged us immediately and treated us like we were good for nothing. We are willing to do whatever was needed to be official members but he was dismissive because we didn’t already know him. Instead of informing us he was so aggressive and disgusted by us. He said any church that would marry us just wants the money which was highly uncalled for. He treated us like degenerates when all we did was meet with him to find out what we needed to do. We hope to raise our future children in the church and as an introductory meeting it was a nightmare. I’m saddened and humiliated by the way he treated us, he was hostile the second we walked into his office. It was such a disheartening experience, but we won’t give up we will find another church to join and get married. The whole meeting lasted five minutes tops before he gave us back the copies of my sacraments and sent us on our way. If you’re going to get married here make sure you know the Father Vijay and that he has some kind of rapport with you because no couple deserves the rudeness, anger and hostility we received.
