When it came time to consign again this winter, Jane would allow me to bring only Spring items, and I had to wait weeks for an appointment. Then Jane was a no show!\nBecause I was coming from another appointment, I waited half an hour outdoors in the cold and impending rain with my baby in the stroller, while a would-be purchasing Dad with an adorable 4-1/2-month-old girl pushed their pram back and forth on the sidewalk in order to stay warm. Finally, both parents gave up. My phone messages 9 minutes and 16 minutes after posted opening time went unanswered. When I called later in the day, Jane said she’d opened only “five or six minutes late.” My cell phone doesn’t lie about the time.\nThen I asked what my balance was from the earlier consignment: $4.95. You are seeing the decimal point in the right place. It is inconceivable that a consignment of 20 never-used to lightly used brands like Hanna Anderson, Laura Ashley, and Pea in the Pod (including four pairs of shoes, only one of which had ever been worn—once) would have sold for the un-grand total of $16.50. I asked how much the used pink boots I had seen in the window cost: $20.00. So my entire 20-piece consignment and the hassle of jumping through Jane’s weeks-long waits, schlepping to the far LES, would earn me not quite ¼ of one item for my daughter.\nA couple of other disgruntled former or would-be consigners mention Clementine as an alternative. Unfortunately, it has closed. I have been unable to find another shop that takes children’s clothes on consignment, which I take it is the reason Jane gets away with exploiting her clientele. (There’s probably lots of turnover but just as many not-yet disabused newcomers filling Jane’s overpriced closet.)\nPersonally, I have decided to donate the beautiful items Jane couldn’t be bothered to show up to consign for me to the Reloved Boutique at Manny Cantor Center and the Parents Center at Henry Street Settlement.
