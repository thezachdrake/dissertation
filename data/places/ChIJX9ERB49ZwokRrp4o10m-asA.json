The Zen Center is very peaceful, clean and if it's your first time visiting you will feel welcomed. There is an area to hang up your coat and a place to place your shoes because you will need to take them off. The Zen Center is within a building so don't look for a sign saying the center is there just follow the number address."},"publishTime":"2016-12-10T14:46:11Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.721785680291504,"longitude":-74.0044036697085},"low":{"latitude":40.719087719708504,"longitude":-74.0071016302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":9,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":0,"hour":10,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":40}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":7,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":2,"hour":8,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":18,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":2,"hour":20,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":7,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":3,"hour":8,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":18,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":3,"hour":20,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":7,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":4,"hour":8,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":17,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":4,"hour":18,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: Closed","Tuesday: 7:30 – 8:30 AM, 6:30 – 8:00 PM","Wednesday: 7:30 – 8:30 AM, 6:30 – 8:00 PM","Thursday: 7:30 – 8:30 AM, 5:30 – 6:30 PM","Friday: Closed","Saturday: Closed","Sunday: 9:30 – 10:40 AM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"Former tenant, Jewel Buddhist Ctr, wrongly shown on Street View, Entrance located off of 260 W Broadway, 1G, St Johns Ln, New York"}
