When I was looking for my second full time nanny job, it was the first time I went through an agency. I felt like I was with every nanny agency in Manhattan and I learned SO much during this process. I experienced a lot of different agent styles, from the founder of Mulberry Agency who gave me a half smile/half grimace while continuing her phone call and had me wait ten minutes before even shaking my hand to an agency I “met” via facetime who seemed to take it personally when I turned down a job I got offered. There were many agencies that felt like “factory” agencies where it seemed they only cared about signing as many contracts as quick as possible without putting in other efforts I saw from others.                                        I had heard about Home Front from the nanny who took over for me from my first nanny job (I left them to teach full time for a couple of years). She found all of her jobs from them and highly recommended them. When I walked in the first time and met with Bonnie, the director, I felt like I was speaking with one of my Aunts. I felt so comfortable, respected and like it was pleasure to have me there. I filled out the paperwork at that first meeting and then had a meeting with Bonnie where we chatted about my background and what I was looking for in a nanny family. She made clear that she wasn’t going to send me on a billion interviews, but that their company policy is to truly make sure that every interview I would go on is because what I was looking for matched what the family was looking for. Jaime, the Co-Founder, reached out to me a few weeks later saying she had some matches for me and she wanted me to come in so she could officially meet me and also to let me know about the client profiles. I didn’t have a SINGLE agency offer this type of personal service: where they asked me to come in again to go over families in person for a follow-up. Every other agency would e-mail, text or call and just give me an address. Home Front not only wanted to talk to me about job prospects in PERSON, but they also wanted to run the families’ needs by me before just sending me out. This showed me that they don’t want to waste anyone’s time, that they truly value each employee they hire, and that it is truly their priority to find the best matches for every party involved. When I first met Jaime, she made me feel at ease just like Bonnie did. Jaime is one of those people where you feel like the most important person in the room when you are around them! She has the warmest smile, and is truly genuine. She let me know about the families she had that met what I was looking for, and made sure they were situations I was comfortable with. She sent out my resume and while I didn’t hear back from those particular families, I got a phone call from Jaime a couple of weeks later letting me know about a family she felt would be perfect for me and I went on the interview that same week and have been with this family for almost two years! Since then, I have always felt so grateful to Jaime and have checked in with her a few times to tell her how lucky I feel she matched me with them. I am telling you to run, not walk to work with Home Front Staffing and you won’t be disappointed. There isn’t another agency in NYC that provides the type of care Home Front does. My bosses also love their end of the process working with them and have recommended them to other families in the building who have had equal success. I wanted to share my experience because of the gratitude I feel when I reflect on how I got my dream job. "},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I want to shout from the rooftops how much I love Home Front Lifestyle Staffing: I LOVE HOME FRONT LIFESTYLE STAFFING!!
