He was quoting the CDC website, but just lifting little phrases out of context, and obviously misconstruing their meaning. I don’t know why he was behaving so rudely and condescendingly to me, but he seemed to be enjoying it. Yet I really needed to get this vaccine THEN because I’m leaving town and had relied on the CVS brand to provide the necessary vaccine as promised. His refusal could not easily be remedied by waiting for another day, because I needed to get this vaccine before I left the state. I did stand there and argue with him and challenge his flagrantly faulty logic, which angered him, so he was increasing rude to me and had this childish pride in being “the decider” and choosing not to meet my urgent need. I think CVS has a rogue and unprofessional guy behind the counter, with way too much authority and leeway, and his unreasonable, illogical, and ultimately dangerous-to-my-health behavior is a discredit to CVS integrity and reliability. I’m gonna guess this is evidence of a deeper “extremist” ideology that he feels emboldened to force on CVS customers. That’s offensive and decidedly unhealthy, in my estimation. The manager of the store said the pharmacist has finally say and she can’t override him (even though I had gone through the official CVS screening and had a formal appt—w/barcode and everything). So. Extremely unpleasant experience AND I will now be at risk for Covid during my upcoming travels. If I get sick, I think this guy should be held accountable. Really, I think he should be fired, but I doubt that will happen. But I highly recommend avoiding him like the PLAGUE (that he seems to promote by his refusal to provide vaccines against it)."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I used the CVS website to qualify for a Covid vaccine (providing all my information and meeting their standard) and then made an appointment.
