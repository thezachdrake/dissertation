She asked me whether I cleaned my clothes before, and found me in the system, and put my order through. It's done quickly and motionlessly before I had a chance to tell her that I had a coupon. I mentioned it anyway, and was told it's too late. I suggested perhaps she could cancel the order, and re-do it with the coupon. She said no. Sure, I can always use it next time. So, I just told her to make sure to put the marks under the arm areas since she didn't do so before. She said yes, but didn't move. I thought she was busy, and would do it later since she'd agreed. I started waiting for the tailer. When it was my turn, the tailer was very nice and patient. We discussed all the details, and I asked her if it's ok for me to try the pinned blouses again with the bra since it's altered tighter than before. She agreed, and went out to talk with another customer. All the sudden, Alexandra impatiently asked me to be quick because another customer was also waiting for the tailer while I was changing. I immediately said sure, but felt uncomfortable. When I came out, I told her calmly that I didn't like the way she talked to me. She started arguing with me. At a point, I had to raise my voice to stop her talking to me. I accused her to be a racist, and asked her to get back my two silk blouses that I had ordered to be dry cleaned. She gave them back to me without any regret or hesitation. I didn't see the marks under the arm areas, and questioned her on that, but she won't let me finish my sentence, and started arguing with me again by saying the same thing, which was how much time I took with the tailer.
