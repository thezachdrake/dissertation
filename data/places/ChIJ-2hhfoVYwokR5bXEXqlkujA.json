Enter Honeybreak officiants, and specifically Celine, who was our patient, kind, knowledgable, flexible guide through all of these points and so much more. Celine truly gave us the ceremony we had been dreaming of, and we knew within moments of sitting down to speak with her for the first time that she was the officiant for us. One thing we learned while searching for our officiant was that they oftentimes come prepared with a vision of how the ceremony will go. When we listened to them describe their services, we could feel almost immediately that it was not the right fit for us— either too starched, too religious, or conversely lacking in any traditional elements. Not so with Celine. We gave her a few scant ideas and images of what we wanted for our ceremony, more a vibe than anything else, and she gave us back a fully formatted and beautifully moving ceremony, featuring all of the events and moments we asked for and none that we didn’t. In short, she got us. She knew exactly what we were looking for after talking to us for maybe half an hour. More than that, she continued to work with us to refine our plan, being flexible with wording and offering advice whenever needed, but always making sure our special day was just that: special and uniquely ours. I really can’t say enough about the great work Celine did, but if our testimony is not enough, we had friends and family members coming up to us all throughout the reception telling us how wonderful and moving they found the ceremony to be.
