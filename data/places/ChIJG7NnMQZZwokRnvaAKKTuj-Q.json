I understand due to recent viral videos that they are busy with orders, and servicing influencers, but as for me I saved up all my Pennies to buy the most flawless human hair for these braids. I was on a hunt for over a year. And I was told I couldn’t return unused hair or get a refund- not a big issue as I just decided to install all bundles for a full human hair look.
