I got to name my price range and we settled on a date and time. My folks got to sample 5 whiskies new to them, with a complimentary cocktail to start and a second pour of their favorite to cap off the evening.\n\nThe guide, Kevin, was extremely friendly and patient. As I bore witness, being the designated driver, my parents got to have their fill of increasingly tipsy conversating and drinking both. Kevin prepared something of a small presentation about each whiskey, giving some interesting background facts as well as his own professional opinions. I also spoke to Rachael via text beforehand, to whom I sent an encyclopedia-length list of all the whiskies I knew my parents have tried, liked, and keep at home, to better offer them a selection they wouldn't have had before. With success! Everything was new to them, and not only that, but they both found a whiskey they liked enough to want to introduce into their daily selection to sip at home. They also both raved about the place afterward and expressed an eagerness to find a reason to come back.\n\nAnd this last bit is a personal thing, but my parents (especially my mom) both have pretty thick accents, and when I'm out with them I often notice people will be impatient or outright rude to them because of it. I'm pretty sensitive to it, as I hate to think that they are being given disrespect or worse service for the crime of speaking two languages. And naturally, being a bit drunk doesn't improve the communication situation. However, Kevin remained positive, attentive, and kind throughout the entire tasting. Not a single \"I don't understand your english\" or looking to me to \"translate\". It might not be a big deal to some, but I appreciate that they were treated with courtesy from beginning to end.\n\nOverall, a 10/5 experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in whiskey, expert or novice.
