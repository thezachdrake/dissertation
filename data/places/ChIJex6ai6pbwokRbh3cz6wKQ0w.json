The staff was very nice throughout the trip. We went through the security checkpoint and the staff was really nice and the staff who helped us board the ship were also really chill and answered any questions we had. We went in January so it was very cold and snowing. There are incredible views of the statue while on the boat approaching its island. The walkways were kind of slippery on the island but we made it inside and it took us about 20 minutes to walk up all the stairs to get to the top of the crown. There is a small museum before you reach the pedestal. The stairs from the pedestal to the crown are very narrow but it is super cool to see the inside of the statue. After exiting the statue there is a larger museum with the original torch and an informative theatre room. There is a small national park gift shop and a larger gift shop dedicated to the statue of liberty and a cafe. The boat then takes you to Ellis Island with more beautiful views of the statue and the Ellis Island itself. I would definitely recommend this tour and in the winter it was not too crowded with little to no wait times for any of the stops throughout and we were not able to walk out on the pedestal due to falling ice. Make sure to bring heavy jackets hats gloves and boots though it does get very warm walking up to the crown. Make sure to buy tickets in advance because crown tickets do sell out very quickly."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I had a great time on the trip and i think it is well worth the money at $25 to go all the way up to the crown.
