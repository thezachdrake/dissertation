WOW what a great experience.  Dinner was superb, the room is beautiful and very romantic, everyone was dressed to the nines (men be sure to wear a jacket and you will feel most comfortable with a tie, ladies dress to impress).  Lots of famous people were there and the place was packed.  Not an open seat on a Wednesday night.  Be sure to get reservations.  For great apps we suggest the figs with prosciutto which is sliced thicker than in other joints and makes it taste great, also loved the artichoke heart carpaccio (thinly sliced and yummy) with poached qual eggs.  that is a great taste combo.  Also love the smoked salmon blini with caviar which was delicate and flavorful.  For the main courses you cannot go wrong with the HUGE soufflés'.  We had the mushroom which was really good and filling even though it was as light as a cloud.  She had the lobster Raviolis with the Bruere Blanc sauce which is a light white sauce full of flavors.  For dessert you cannot go wrong with any of the soufflés.  We had both the pistachio and the grand Marnier and both was super good.  We also had the Crepes Flamed Orange medallions with Grand Marnier which were very good.  We did not take any food photos because it was a bit too high class for me to be schlepping photos at the table, but I wish I had so you could see how pretty each dish looked.  This place pays attention to the details and that is why it has been one of the city's best restaurants for nearly 60 years.  This is a winner with 2 thumbs way up.    Check out all of our reviews.  If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic.  Follow us if you like.
