Eduardo then tells me that the billing cycle begins on the first of every month and that my $200 was only for the time in April.  I explained to him that the previous rep had set me up for one month from April 14th at $200.  Eduardo told me that the rep was wrong and I would have to pay regardless of rep's mistake.  This alone was very rude and unprofessional.  I then asked how I could be set up for monthly billing when I never signed a contract.  He brings me a blank contract and says \"You never signed this?\"  I told him \"No, and it makes sense considering the previous rep was only setting me up for one month.\"  Eduardo then tries to make me believe that the profile form I filled out with my name and vehicle information; was a contract.  This was a blatant lie.  I told him that I actually went to law school so I know exactly what a contract is.  The form has no terms or conditions.  It didn't even list any pricing.  Eduardo is either very uneducated in professional conduct in a work environment.  I ended up having to contact the corporate headquarters directly before the issue was resolved.
