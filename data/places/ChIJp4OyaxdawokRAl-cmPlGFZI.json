Yet another call to Citibank, more hold times, and transfers,  we got the Citibank representative to confirm with the former bank that the charges were fraudulent. That person assured us that everything was taken care of. The following month we received another bill, with additional late fees. This was infuriating beyond belief. The process was repeated again. The following month, it was the same story. At this point there are now three late payments on my wife's credit report without merit. We have continued to spend countless hours on the phone attempting to get Citibank to rectify this situation since April.\n\nIt's now September and my wife's credit has now prevented us from getting the full amount of a home improvement loan that we applied for, as well as prevented us from being able to refinance our home loan.
