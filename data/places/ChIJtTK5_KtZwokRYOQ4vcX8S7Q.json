I called to inquire on when my order would be shipped as it had already day been two days and my order still hadn’t shipped. She reviewed the order and said she didn’t know when it would ship, but from what she could see the order wasn’t even put together yet. I then asked her to cancel the order because their process seemed a bit slow. I also asked questions pertaining to how the cancellation worked. She was unable to provide me with any information and could only tell me she would send an email to that department because she wasn’t sure how that process worked. She also informed me that the only way I could speak with that department is if they called me. About 4 hours after our call I received an email saying my order had been shipped so I called back and the same lady answered. I told her my order had shipped and asked if she could override the original request to cancel the order. Again, all she could do was send an email to that department because she had no information on whether that was possible or how that process worked and I would have to wait for them to call me to find out. I asked her if they had a turn around time for returning calls and she stated she did not know. Basically the customer service department knows nothing other than whether your order shipped or not. If you have any other questions or concerns you have to wait for whichever department to call you and there is no time frame in which they will call you back. So as of right now, I have two requests sitting in the inbox of whichever department deals with refunds. I have a cancellation  request and a request to not cancel as well as a request for a returned telephone call. Depending on which request they receive first will determine whether I get my package or not. In the meantime I am unsure if I need to go elsewhere to purchase clothes for my child that is due soon or if I Will receive a call and my package. Very, very, sloppy.
