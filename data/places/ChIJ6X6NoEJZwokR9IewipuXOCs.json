I found Leigh through a friend and from the intro call onwards it was clear that Leigh was not only going to invest in my physical strength, but tailor my training to my holistic needs. Leigh has taught me to believe in my physical strength and in doing so has been essential in redefining how I feel on a daily basis. She is so knowledgable, skilled, personable, and kind and I can’t wait to see how her hypertrophy training continues to build my strength. If you invest in Leigh, she will not hesitate to invest in you — the workouts are hard, but there’s a reason Leigh pushes her clients: she truly believes in the strength people hold in their own bodies. When I started with Leigh I couldn’t squat any weight, I couldn’t deadlift, shoulder press, I didn’t even really feel comfortable in a fitness space for a whole host of reasons. 9 months later I’m squatting 245lbs and coming to sessions excited to keep building my list of PRs, which is a 180 from my mentality at the start of my training. When I first started with Leigh she looked me up and down and said something along the lines of “oh yeah you’re gonna be really strong” and I lacked the confidence in myself to believe her. But she was the first person I felt was truly willing to bet on my ability and strength, so I put my full trust in her. I will forever be glad I did. She has a method to her madness and it will leave you not only feeling far stronger, but will give you a true understanding of what it is that makes you strong.

Leigh has not only believed in me but coached me to believe in myself. Working with Leigh,  I have had numerous PRs in my main lifts, she  helped me fix my imbalances in my squat form, analyzed my anatomy to ensure the best and most comfortable set up for my deadlifts, and not only does my body feel stronger all around, my body composition has completely changed for the better. I didn’t change a single thing outside of our sessions together and I actually cut back on the quantity of my training all together.

There’s always a reason behind  her programming and she will always explain it.  Her coaching style is being a super smart and strategic coach, your best friend and cheerleader on your hardest days, your therapist (if you want her to be) and the sister that gives you the tough love when you need it the most.\n\nYou have changed my life, Leigh, not just in the gym but in how I show up in the world.
