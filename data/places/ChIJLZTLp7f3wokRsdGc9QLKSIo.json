Her technique and playfulness and patience are unmatched, and she works hard to make each lesson fun and instructive. Through movement, games, and exercises at the piano, Sandy bit by bit builds knowledge and confidence, and I trust that her approach (coupled with parent participation) will keep kiddos excited about music as they get older. Five stars all the way!
