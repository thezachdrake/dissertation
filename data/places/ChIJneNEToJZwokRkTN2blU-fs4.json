could on our own, we were at a loss in terms of how to handle his behavioral issues. Unfortunately, despite all the interventions that we tried based on our own research, the situation was only getting worse. We loved Joey so much, but we knew that things were not sustainable if they would have continued the way they were going.\n\nWe were feeling scared, hopeless, and discouraged. Finally, we found School for the Dogs and Anna, and that’s when things finally started to turn around. Being students with extremely limited resources, we knew that we couldn’t afford to pay for the type of care that Joey needed, and we felt so sad and guilty that we were not able to provide the best possible life for him. When we were approved for the scholarship program, we finally saw the first glimmer of hope for our family.\n\nAnna completely changed our perception of what is possible when it comes to training dogs. Her methodology, which involves lots of positive reinforcement and not punishment, helped to strengthen our relationship with Joey, and to understand his needs, preferences, and communication style better than ever before. It almost feels like she taught us to read his mind, and to anticipate his reactions, which gives us a much better handle on them. She taught us new commands and feasible ways for us to continue implementing Joey’s training on our own. She also helped to guide us through the intimidating process of seeking out medication for Joey, helping to round out the support that he needs.\n\nToday, we are so proud and grateful to report that things are finally getting better, not worse. Joey is moving in the right direction, and we are more confident than ever before that we know what to do to help him be calmer and to even keep himself under control. I was most impressed with how Anna employs principles of psychology into her training, recognizing both the individualized and universal needs of her students (including dogs and humans alike). I used to joke that it seems like she is ‘psychic’ with dogs, but now I understand that by knowing what to look for and how to approach different situations, anyone can learn to communicate and work with their dog more effectively, no matter how far-gone things may once have appeared. We will be eternally thankful to School for the Dogs for the amazing work that they do, as well as to the generous benefactors of the scholarship program for enabling us to attain the resources we needed to finally enjoy greater peace and happiness in our home.
