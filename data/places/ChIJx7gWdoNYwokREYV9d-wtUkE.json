Jen, who I worked with throughout the process, proposed having the musicians record the music in a studio before the ceremony and use a speaker to play the music at the ceremony. She executed a miracle by hiring the musicians and getting the studio space last minute. They recorded the music the morning of the wedding day, and we played it at the ceremony that afternoon. It was beyond my wildest dreams amazing. That is a long winded way to say that you could not find better, more dedicated group of musicians to work with. They are brilliantly talented, and incredibly dedicated. Work with them.
