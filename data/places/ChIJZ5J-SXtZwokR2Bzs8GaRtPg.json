So I went as a medical professional to see a bedbound patient in the area. Just a quick wellness check no exam just a check. I got to LAZ parking.

He kept mentioning the prices over and over.I understood what he what sayings. He could have said it English,Spanish and French and I would have understood in all the 5 languages I speak. You know when someone is telling you something bc they normally screw people over with exactly what they are talking about (foreshadowing). That is what this man was doing when I thought about it later.  I parked, went to the patient, got back at the 27 to 30minutes mark but the man was getting someone else’s car (oldsmobile) who was checking out . By the time he got to me it was 37 minutes. He took his sweet time to run the clock yes so I paid $37 for 37 minutes of parking. It’s not the money it’s the principle. Even in New York how can someone pay $37 for $37 minutes of parking. It’s absurd and use other parking garages. He called the manager and proceeded to speak in Spanish which he thought I wouldn’t understand. The manager then told me I was there for 37 minutes according to when the parking attendants scanned my ticket without realizing I was there prior but the man took his sweet old time. I will never use LAZ as a company. Total rip off. The man was so rude. Ready to fight me for no reason ( first time\nI’m my life of existence ), uncouth, unemployable anywhere, bad service all in all.
