For instance, my daughter is obsessed with dinosaurs, so all the lessons magically tapped into that (e.g., [in Spanish] what color is a dinosaur? blue? No! green! Yes! etc.)  My daughter felt like she was just talking dinos with her friend, and we're thrilled by the vocabulary and comfort she is developing in another language.  In addition, when covid required everything to shift online, we considered dropping lessons because it felt too hard for an 8 year old to pay attention over Zoom in a foreign language.  But Bea is so good with Zoom that our daughter loved it -- she looks forward to her lessons every week, and especially likes having a chance to draw on the ipad and sing along with songs.

Great school."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is by far the best language instruction I have ever received.
