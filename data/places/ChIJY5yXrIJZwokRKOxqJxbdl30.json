We had the Mezza plate with hummus, and kababs (octopus, chicken, steak).  First off, the mezza plate would have been enough for dinner by itself. And was sooooo good. Hummus, pickles, potato salad, pickled onions, olives, cucumbers, tahini, beets, spicy carrots, and baba ganoush. What I loved most were their pitas. Unlike most places where you get pita bread that is thin and a bit dry, their's were thick and bready. Absolutely to die for!!  And all the meats were really good!  Rich flavors and perfectly cooked.
