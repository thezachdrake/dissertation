The first impression was okay. The seller came up to be and asked what do I want. There was no introduction to the perfume house or anything. I didn’t know much about this perfume house other than portrait a lady, so I asked him if I could try that. Without communicating more to know what exactly I want, he started recommending me other scents. I did not like the third and forth scents he recommended me, so I tried to explain more on what kind of scent I like. When I said I like flower and musk, HE LAUGHED AT ME and said flower and musk don’t go together and there is no such thing. I was very upset at how he was treating me. Then, he stopped me and said that I shouldn’t try more than 5 scents because that is what the perfumers recommend and my nose will not be in good condition to smell these scents.(the way he said was very arrogant) I was more upset because then the seller who was recommending me these perfumes should have tried to get to know me better before he started to recommend things. After that he seems to be not interested in me anymore. I just bought the essential kit to had to get out of there. I went there thinking buying a bottle, but this experience really made me not want to spend single minutes in here and I had to rush out. These are pretty expensive perfumes and they shouldn’t just assume all people can buy $300 perfume by just testing scents for few minutes. That is why the seller is there and they should be the experts in their perfume house to explain/recommend what the customer wants. The other tall seller seems to be very communicative with his customers and professional. It was really shame I had to get recommendations from other guys. He didn’t even care to tell me his name or pass me his name card which other luxury perfume house sellers do. The tall guy looked much professional. I think he said he works for other boutique in upper nyc. I’m going to visit there next and give one more chance to this perfume house.
