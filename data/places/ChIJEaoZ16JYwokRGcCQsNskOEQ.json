I never imagined myself seeing a plastic surgeon and foolishly tried removing my xanthelasmas with a glycolic acid gel sold on Amazon having many excellent reviews.  I ended up scarring my eyes so I called Dr. Gupta's office.   I went for a consultation and Dr. Gupta assured me she could help.  It is now a bit past four months since my initial surgery.  I am happier than I've been in years.  I only wear mascara now and do not need to glob on make up to cover up spots.  In addition to removing my xanthelasma and scar tissue, she gave me an upper and lower blepharoplasty.  My eyes look more open, like they did when I was younger.  I will never regret the money spent and am so happy I met Dr. Gupta.  While she is expensive, as all top surgeons are, she is a perfectionist.  The price includes checking my eyes every 8 weeks and giving additional laser treatments when necessary.
