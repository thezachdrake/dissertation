As someone with a lot of thin, dry, kinky/curly hair, it’s almost impossible to find stylists that can actually do a good job with it, whether that’s a hair cut or any type of treatment. But this place was a gem I stumbled upon after years of struggling with my hair and paying a lot of money on treatments that didn’t work. Now, here I am two months later after getting my keratin treatment with Leah and I’ve never loved my hair this much! I grew up having to cut my hair, almost close enough to shaving it, to styling my hair and taking care of it in ways I didn’t think possible. My hair is now hydrated, healthy, and a lot easier to manage, plus I get a lot of compliments whether I leave it curly or do it straight now! PS. I came all the way from Texas to visit family here and just had to come back to do my hair because I love them so much!\n\nAside from them being amazing at hair, going to this salon is like going to your family on Christmas, they’re so homey and loving and so easy to open up to (and I’m an introvert). I say “them” because the entire staff is absolutely fabulous. They don’t just do your hair, they study it, advise you, and give you tips on how to take care of your hair without you even asking. I remember the owner once saw my eyebrows being curly and all over the place and he came up to me while I’m getting my hair done and offered to fix them up for me free of charge, it’s something I didn’t expect but admired because you can see how much they care. They’re not after your money like most other places, they genuinely want you to feel your best as you get nothing less than the best. From talking about our daily lives to them dancing to music and enjoying themselves to their amazing refreshments to getting those warm, tight hugs, you won’t find a better place to treat you as the wonderful human you are!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I don’t usually leave reviews but I had to leave a review for this place because I’m hooked.
