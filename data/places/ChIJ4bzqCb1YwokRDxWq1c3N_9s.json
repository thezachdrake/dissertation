Towards the end of my pregnancy I felt that they stopped caring about my well-being and wishes and almost like they did a bait and switch.\n\nFirst: I had stated my wishes to give birth intervention free unless medically necessary from the first appointment I made. I wanted to go into labor naturally and let labor take its course unless there were any indications baby wasn’t doing well etc. They appeared to be very supportive of that and I was so happy to find women doctors from minority backgrounds who I felt would support my goals. I loved their personalities as well. But in week 39 when discussing labor and birth plan, I was told that if I was  in labor when arriving at the hospital and things were progressing fine, they would still want to break my waters. I asked why, and was told “because then you would be in pain for a shorter amount of time”. It’s a well known fact that breaking the water with or without cause will result in labor intensifying significantly and making everything a lot more painful, a lot faster. Surely, my pain management was not the reason they’d want to break my water. Breaking the water without letting it happen on its own is done to rush labor. It felt manipulative to tell me it had to do with my pain not lasting as long when I have medical conditions that could mean any intensified and sudden pain could cause complications. They were not as supportive of natural unmedicated birth as they portrayed themselves to be. If labor is progressing fine, why mess with it? This made me feel very insecure and lose all trust at the very end of my pregnancy. I’ve been traumatized by doctors in hospitals before and had also informed them of that. So feeling like I know who they are and what they stand for was extremely important for me in order to feel safe.\n\nSecond: I am frequently anemic due to a medical condition and have very low iron storage on a frequent basis. I see a hematologist and get iron infusions as needed. I trusted these drs to test my iron (as many pregnant women become anemic, it was likely I would since I’m anemic when not pregnant at all). But the only thing they were concerned with was appeasing the anesthesiologist at the hospital who demanded a letter with proof that I didn’t have a specific vascular disorder that I know I don’t have. I needed to produce a letter with proof of a diagnosis I was given in another country 15 years prior. I was specifically told; when asked about my blood results “I wouldn’t be concerned with your iron, just get the letter from your hematologist”. I went to the hematologist who was OUTRAGED. Not only did she say there was absolutely no reason such a letter was needed as there were absolutely no indications of me having this vascular bleeding disorder, but she was appalled and worried about how low my values were so late in pregnancy. She said “you can’t go into labor with iron this low and that’s what they should be concerned about”. So now I had to commute to the city every day in week 39 to get iron infusions. Not what a woman should be doing so late in pregnancy. And as a result, I got Covid despite taking every precaution. Had they taken care of me sooner instead of putting it off to the very last minute, I wouldn’t have been rushing to get my iron values up before labor and getting Covid. And so I had to give birth while sick with Covid, and ended up at a totally different hospital without doctors I knew because labor happened so quickly and I was so sick the ambulance needed to take me to my closest hospital. It was a traumatic experience that took me and my family months to recover from.\n\nIt is truly sad that reasonable, rational and educated women have to struggle so hard to find doctors who genuinely care. I understand being busy & slipping up, or hospitals pressuring drs to do things, or needing to intervene when necessary…but I paid to be respected and cared for, not to have a false belief they had my best interest at heart when hospital policies and politics mean more to them."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was very happy with the care received until later in pregnancy.
