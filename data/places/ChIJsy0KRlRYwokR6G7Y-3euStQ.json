Hopefully they have options for those with mobility issues, but I admittedly didn't see any myself.\n\nThe only bathrooms are well-attended, so you won't run out of tissue paper or paper towels for your hands, and it will be clean thanks to the sweet bathroom attendant. But the bathrooms are a bit cramped, and are down a set of stairs into the basement level of the byilding. Also, the bathroom line for the women's restroom at intermission stretched up those stairs, doubled over itself in a long hallway, and down into the theatre almost all the way to the stage. My advice? Don't drink anything at dinner or during the show, and just bring some peppermint or gum (which you will of course unwrap strategically BEFORE the show starts, thank you - because that crinkle is infuriating) to pop into your mouth to stifle any dehydrated coughing.\n\nThe guy running the bar at the mezzanine level is SO sweet, so definitely don't neglect to go up there and order your drink if you decide to brave it with the bathroom situation. Do realize, also, that a simple cocktail in the plastic collectible Hamilton cup will cost you about $40. Another reason to skip the drinks, maybe?\n\nAnother note - I know you probably feel entirely capable of finding your seats by yourself, but when you pause or hesitate to decide where to walk next, you hold up every person behind you, and there are often a lot. There are literally lovely ushers in place every few dozen feet to help you find your seats and answer any questions you have, so please ask them instead of trying to tough it out on your own.\n\nOh, and the show? Oh my gosh, the show. What an experience! Any frustration with the bathroom situation is quickly overtaken by utter thrill at this incredible production! I'm not history buff, but seeing and adoring Hamilton doesn't require that you be aware of history in virtually any way. Unlike Wicked and most other musicals, this does not have lines that lead into musical numbers, then more lines after. The spoken-word/rap style of Lin-Manuel Miranda means that almost every single audible utterance in this entire production is part of a song. There is musical number after musical number, all beautifully written, blocked, lit, choreographed, sung, and accompanied by a killer orchestra. There is little wonder why this show is so popular.
