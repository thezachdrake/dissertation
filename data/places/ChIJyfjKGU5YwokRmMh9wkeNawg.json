The staff are polite and helpful but again...don't expect a boutique experience in customer service either and for a multi-story large store ( different departments[housing, clothing, furniture, etc.] on different floors) it can still be a little crowded or at least it was when I stopped in. Most of my fellow customers were tourists, locals from the neighborhood, a few boutique buyers on the hunt for stuff to resale at their shops, and most notably a group of 20 or so well meaning but rather frustrating ( to the staff at least, lol) immigrants that were trying to ( quite smoothly I might add) barter the prices lower in what I think was Portuguese? I don't know what language and neither did the store staff, lol. Lord have mercy on them because it was a situation worthy of an SNL skit. Ha! A lot of smiles around the room watching that mess go down. SO there you have it, like everywhere in NYC the rich and poor and middleclass all live and shop at the same places sometimes, The Salvation Army Store is one of those places.
