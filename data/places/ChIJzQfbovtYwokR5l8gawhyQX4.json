And then, suddenly, they do, and this love that erupts between them makes this want to finally dress—perhaps for the first time—as their truest self on their wedding day, to the person they were made for in this life. Thus begins this person's journey to find the creative team that would help realize this ambition: to create a custom garment that would encompass so many things that makes them who they are.\n\nThis person is, naturally, myself, and after much searching, I found that team at The Tailory NYC. The moment I walked into their office, before they had even met me or knew my M.O., I was made to feel right at home (especially after they offered to mix me a Negroni!). Within an hour, after showing them my Pinterest board, and patiently listening to my big-picture/no-details soliloquy about what the final product should feel like, we had come up with a concept. I knew I wanted a patterned fabric, and The Tailory's selection of fabrics that they they can source is staggering in their breadth. I would have asked them to make me curtains out of some of them, and I still might. But more impressively, unlike every other tailor that I had consulted with in NYC (and there was a hefty amount), they offered to screen my own pattern onto a fabric and construct the piece from that. I nearly collapsed from excitement. The possibilities were endless!\n\nWhat followed was a long process of trying pin down what this custom pattern would be. Thanks to the help of a genius fellow-artist friend, the pattern was eventually arrived at, and upon submitting the .pngs to The Tailory, a beautiful, silky, custom fabric was ready in a matter of weeks.\n\nNow we come to the work the team was able to pull off. At the start, the team took my measurements with particular attention to granular detail. This, of course, is what tailors do, but in my experience, few do it on their level. When the time came for the first fitting of the suit, I was nearly in tears: it fit hand-in-glove. Not a single adjustment had to be made; I could have gallivanted out of the studio and into the street!\n\nBut that was not all: there was still the matter of a shirt to go with the garment. Ultimately, the Tailory made two beautiful versions of their in-house organza shirt design, both exhibiting their loving attention to what would drape my body effortlessly and the superior quality of their fabrics.\n\nWhen the Big Day finally came, and I and my spouse opened our eyes to see each other for the first time in full regalia, we both cried, we had never seen each other so beautifully, purely ourselves. Immediately, my thoughts went to nothing but the deepest gratitude to the team that helped make that moment possible. Not only were they excited with the creative challenge of my project from the start; they showed up with an empathy and gentleness that was by no means necessary, but so comforting to a client facing the overwhelming emotions that I was reckoning with. In short, I felt taken care of, and I felt the love for what they do in every stitch. Observe the photos, the work speaks for itself.\n\nWhen I refer to the team that make up The Tailory, it is truly a collective of individuals that makes a company like this work. And so I will say now: Silke, Tobey, Yumna, Shao, David, and everyone else whose hands touched this project—thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my full, mushy heart. I will be back again for more wacky creative ventures, and I know they'll be happy to get creative and weird with you as well!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"So let me tell you a little story about a person who never thought they were going to meet the love of their life.

Not only were they excited with the creative challenge of my project from the start; they showed up with an empathy and gentleness that was by no means necessary, but so comforting to a client facing the overwhelming emotions that I was reckoning with. In short, I felt taken care of, and I felt the love for what they do in every stitch. Observe the photos, the work speaks for itself.\n\nWhen I refer to the team that make up The Tailory, it is truly a collective of individuals that makes a company like this work. And so I will say now: Silke, Tobey, Yumna, Shao, David, and everyone else whose hands touched this project—thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my full, mushy heart. I will be back again for more wacky creative ventures, and I know they'll be happy to get creative and weird with you as well!"},"publishTime":"2023-11-19T19:34:46Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJzQfbovtYwokR5l8gawhyQX4/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxMnNTYldnEAE","rating":5,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJEfgAIen-dbExAGB7l0I01DLac5ai6ytn7gurUOrkt=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117628968644384170609/reviews","displayName":"Jume Lee"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The Tailory has been incredible to work with from the beginning to the end of my husband's custom wedding suit.
