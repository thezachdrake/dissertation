Our room was quite small but it was all we needed as we were out and about each day. The room was super clean and the room was cleaned each day of our stay. Towels were changed out as needed. The only thing is that we did not have much a view of times square. The window in our room was just a view of a wall but not a big deal as I believe it is a smaller hotel business. We slept good and had no issues with it being loud. We didn't notice anything and had no issues sleeping. As for the employees at the hotel, they were all super friendly and nice. They made check in and check out fast and easy. Made sure to greet us each time they saw us and also let us know when they would lock the doors during night hours. This was great as it made me feel safe staying here knowing that they lock their lobby doors during certain hours. They were also able to hold our luggage and bags for us, free of charge-when we arrived too early to check in and when we were waiting to head to the airport on our last day."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Stayed at this hotel during our trip to New York in July 2023.

You should either go alone or go with someone you are VERY COMFORTABLE with. The size of the room is the tiniest I’ve ever been in. You take one step and you and your partner are on top of each other. The bed was the worst I’ve ever been on. I’m not sure if the person before us broke it or it’s normally that bumby. It had so many lumps and bumbs that it was slanting and I would roll to my partners side. The view is a brick wall and I could never tell if it was morning or night cause it was always dark. The storage is nice but I think if the pictures gave a realistic view I would’ve went elsewhere. The front desk people were nice and the convenience of location was great. If you find cheaper then go but if not then you can still go here as long as it’s a short trip. Lastly, my confirmation said checkout was at 12 yet the door locked us out at 11.
