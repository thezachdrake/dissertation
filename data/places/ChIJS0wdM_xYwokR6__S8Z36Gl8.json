King’s office at NYC Orthopedic Group at 2044 Ocean Ave, Brooklyn location. Here are some things I’ve experienced:\nI have never seen Dr. King in his office until I had surgery on 9/10. I’ve seen several of his PAs, but they are never the same.\nHis staff has poor communication and is dismissive. They will give unnecessary run around in reaching Christina, who seems to be the person responsible for providing documentation.\nStaff will call to ask to come in earlier than the scheduled appointment time when coming in for a 3:30 p.m. or 4 p.m. appointment, although business closes at 5 p.m. Sometimes, I come from work and would do a half day to go in at those times.\nStaff will cancel appointments without relaying that information to local office and schedule you for appointments without letting you know.\nAdmin staff refused to provide the documentation required for employment leave after two weeks of trying to obtain this document. I had to get my lawyers involved, who were also given the runaround. I eventually received the letter through my lawyer one week later, which was insufficient for my job and needed revision. Again, the revised note took one week to receive and was submitted to my lawyer. Remember this is through email, not snail mail (a total of three weeks).\nWhen calling for a post-operative appointment, the system was down. It happens, I understand, but an appointment was made without me being aware until I called and was informed I had an appointment. My issue with this is that had I not called. I wouldn’t have been aware until the last minute.\nAfter my post-operative appointment on 9/19, nine days after surgery, I received a letter the next day from Valeria, which had incorrect dates and looked thrown together. I responded to her email explaining that the PA discussed extending my leave, following up in four weeks and speaking to Christina, who is in charge of documentation, and I should get this done right away. Valeria called me the following morning, and I explained further the overlap of my return to duty date (10/10) and next follow-up appointment which would fall on 10/17. She stated I couldn’t get an extension without coming in disregarding medical professionals directives.\nIn person no issues but anything over the phone is a nightmare. No documentation is given at the office location everything is done verbally.\nDr. King seems like a pleasant doctor; I spoke to him before and after surgery. He did keep me informed and assured me I would get a revised letter on my surgery date (that didn’t happen). His staff's poor communication and lack of regard overshadow his business. I wouldn’t recommend anyone seek treatment with this doctor or his establishment. It seems like other reviewers have encountered similar situations as I did. Do better and work on improving patient services and training of administrative staff members. Also, it would be beneficial that the PA communicates with admin staff or chart patient leave so the patient does not have to advocate profusely."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I currently receive treatment at Dr. William L.
