She had a midwife with her telling me I looked EXHAUSTED and would have no energy to push if I didn’t take a nap. It simply wasn’t true. Dr. Teaiwa used coercion and manipulation to speed everything up leading to PTSD and a separation of mother and baby. I was having a beautifully blessed pregnancy and labor until I went into her care. But care is most definitely not a word that can be used. We were a number in her night. When I asked about Cornell’s 98% epidural rate and what I was missing, the answer was her. Because I certainly resisted and was happy without. She doesn’t believe in a woman’s choices or abilities.
