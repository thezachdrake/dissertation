Just happened upon this place walking from Washington Square back uptown. Glad I took the chance."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Thankfully this was my 1st NY slice as the second slice I had at another place couldn't hold it's own against frozen grocery pizza.
