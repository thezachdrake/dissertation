I recently moved to this area and the closest laundry is this one. I’ve been  taking my clothes to this exact location for them to wash it. About 2 months ago when I picked up my clothes and went to check them, all the white and grey clothes were stained in a different color (light pink and orange). I went to the laundry about 5 days after the incident and told them what happened, they said they couldn’t help me because it was days after already. They told me that if this issue were to happen again, they would give me a free wash or in cash the value of the pieces ruined. The next washing I took my clothes like normal, obviously expecting a good service. In this specific washing I told the lady at the front that I had delicate pieces in a blue bag to please be careful, I repeated this twice, and she said to not worry that she would wash it herself. I went 2 days later to pick up my laundry. Something told me to check my clothes since they were hesitating to give me the blue bag that had the delicate pieces. SAME thing happens again. I had a very special white dress that hold a special memory, and this dress was now totally stained pink, when it should be white. I was very upset and asked to speak to the manager. They told me that for any issue or refunds I would have to wait for the manager which wasn't in that day. At this point I was a bit aggravated and I just felt like they weren't owning up to the fact that I specifically had stated the issue when I walked in. The worse thing about this situation is how bad I was treated and how rude they were to me. The lady told me that it was my fault I didn't clasify the clothes before giving it to her, and that she wasn't aware that if she put all the clothes together, they would stain.They never said sorry and never owned to fact of what I had said prior to this. I left without my clothes and told them to please not touch them until I could go the next day and speak to the manager. After 15 minutes of being home I thought about maybe just taking my clothes how they were, and just getting a picture incase the manager wanted proof. When I walk in again and ask for this, they tell me that they can't give me my clothes because they're trying to fix it. My dress was a in a separate washing machine with whitening detergent, when I clearly said to please leave it as is. As I try to explain to them again, they said that they will give me the money, that what else do I want, that my dress could just be trashed and they'll pay for it. After moments of me asking to please just give me my clothes, they gave me the 2 bags in a very rude way, still not apologizing for any of this. I went back before heading to work the next morning, same lady was there, ignored me as I walked in and just said, manager is not here and not sure when he will be.\nBtw, the employee name is Mercedes and another lady"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"DON’T GO TO THIS PLACE.
