Nuestra cuenta en línea no funcionó. Terminamos nuestra cuenta después de muchas dificultades.\n\nI was at first very pleased with the ease of setting up an account (Business Account). However, a couple of red flags occurred which would make me hesitant to continue working with Popular Community Bank or recommend them:\n\n1. The online banking system had an error and didn't have the correct phone numbers for our \"one-time\" verification step. After calling Customer Service 4 times throughout the course of a couple months to fix the number so we could log-in, each time the fix was temporary. We continue to have to call Customer Service each time to log into our account. This problem is still not fixed. I'd be curious to know whether this is an issue that many accounts faced, or if it is only an error with our phone number that for some reason has not been able to be fixed.\n\n2. There is a charge every month ($5 per month) if you do not log into online banking. This was a hidden fee (i.e., not told to us when we registered for the account), and we accumulated fees over the course of the months without knowing. Despite the online banking phone number error that contributed to our inability to log into our online account, these fees were charged.\n\nThere are additional problems we faced in-store (e.g., managers dismissive of issues, poor customer service, near-loss of our organization's files), but these two issues have been ongoing issues for us.\n\nUpdate in July, 2019 (four months after above review):\n\nAfter continuing to work with the store to authenticate our account for online use, the issue remained a problem, and the store recommended we use the mobile app. That was fine for us as a workaround, but it was strange as to why the online login didn't work after multiple attempts to fix the issue.\n\nFinally, we closed our account after the bank notified us that our name needed to have a \"Corp.\" for EIN and NY state name match purposes. I'm not sure why this wasn't brought up when we opened our account. Nevertheless, we agreed to write to the IRB for a name change, which takes a period of 60 days for the name change process. We also called the IRB and they gave a reference number so Popular Community Bank could call and confirm the our name records were appropriate. In the process of this, the bank informed us that they would close our account by post in the mail, despite the clear steps and scanned documents of the steps we were taking.\n\nAt this point, we were frustrated enough with our continued difficulties with Popular Community Bank and were eager to close our account.
