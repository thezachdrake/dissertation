Julie explained all the measurements and approach to sizing the perfect fitting shirt and explained all the options I had in designing my first shirt. While I was there I even got to chat with the Founder, Manuel. A few weeks later I got my first shirt and it fit perfectly.

I get compliments often. 2 years later, the shirt still fits, no issues whatsoever and I continue to wear it for those special occasions. I also ordered my second MR shirt 2 years later and was able to email Julie to let her know to make a few micro adjustments to my chest area due to working out for 2 years my chest was a bit larger.
