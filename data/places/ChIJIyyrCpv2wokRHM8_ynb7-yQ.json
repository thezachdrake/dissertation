At the end of the call I was sent a referral to get a CT scan to monitor the progression of the disease.  I contacted her office to relay my concerns about moving forward with such an invasive procedure and that I was looking for a second opinion.  I then spent months trying to schedule the CT scan she referred, only to find out that her office was actively refusing to forward the referral letter to the insurance company delaying additional review and treatment. I didn't believe this was retaliatory, but after several imaging centers and months of delays with the same issue I got the message loud and clear.
