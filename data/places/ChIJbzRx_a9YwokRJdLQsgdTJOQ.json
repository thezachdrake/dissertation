That’s not to say the food is bad— if you’re used to chicken that doesn’t taste chalky, you know what I mean when I say the meat quality is holding the taste back. That said, their chicken is not chalky until you get to some of the inner parts, and I LOVE the way the skin tastes. The beef smells very good, but I find the meat a little hard to bite into. The mixto ceviche is the best I’ve had in a long time, because they actually give you a variety of fish and it’s not just two pieces of fish. The sangria is house made but a bit too sweet for our liking. I was surprised to see no pisco on the menu.

He told her that the delivery food was different, not going to be crunchy like in the restaurant. Well I know that (as I said, I've ordered calamari before using delivery). My complaint was the Run-DMC tougher than leather calamari that had sadly not been tenderized. No more chances Pio Pio.  Get somebody else to do it. The overly-saturated oily, tough calamari has yet again proved to prevail. To be honest, I mastered how to make tender calamari because of this (I didn't have any in the house today). And I stopped ordering anything from Pio Pio other than the green sauce. I usually make my own calamari, or get a Costco whole-baked chicken. And the sauce is so thin and soupy now. My solution? Mix that green sauce with some mayo, it makes the best aioli dipping sauce ever. With times being as tough as they are, no one has money to throw away, so back to me just getting the green sauce. -$6 for the big container and I'm out $30.
