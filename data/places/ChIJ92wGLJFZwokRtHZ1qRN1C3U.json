I requested him to sing an Aerosmith song and he incorporated their names in the lyrics which was a nice touch. This was a brilliant 2nd act. Rated PG-13.\n\nAnd finally, oh boy... The Male Marilyn Monroe who was played by Luis. I'm not sure what word I can use. Insanely hilarious? You can tell this guy put a lot of thought into this.
