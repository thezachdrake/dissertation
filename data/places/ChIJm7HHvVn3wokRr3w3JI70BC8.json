built with interest and looked at 1 and two bedroom units when they first became available. While unquestionably attractive, I thought their pricing structure was unreasonably high and did not consider them further for that reason.\nRecently I received an email about dramatic price reductions and was told that a unit I was potentially interested in had been reduced from 2M to 1.6M.  I am all too aware of “bait and switch” strategies where low-ball listings are dangled in hopes of attracting multiple full price offers  and a subsequent bidding war., I was suspicious that this would be the case here. I told the sales agent bluntly that I had no interest unless the stated asking price was legitimate. She assured me that if I made a full price cash offer and that my financial status could be verified, my offer would be accepted at the 1.6 price.  I crossed my fingers and immediately  made an offer as instructed through my agent.\nMy crossed fingers quickly devolved into a double cross, as I was afraid they might. My agent was told that there were other cash offers higher than mine, but that if I increased my offer to 1.7M with no concessions, an effective increase of 150+K, that my offer would probably be accepted. Magically my 400k bargain got sliced in half. At that point I was angry enough to walk away but reluctantly instructed my agent to submit a final offer totaling 1.7M.

We have a fine rental, with comparable view and amenities a block away, and even though I could afford to take a 200k beating, I’m not desperate enough to be jerked around like this by anyone.\nIt’s possible they will of necessity honor the reduced prices on the larger units which are harder to sell. It’s a beautiful building and one of a kind, but all  I can say is CAVEAT EMPTOR! If they treat you like this in the pre-purchase phase, I would have concerns about how I might be treated by management as an owner."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Beware:Bait and Switch is alive and well at 145 Central Park North\n\nSince I rent nearby, I have watched this luxury complex as it was being built with interest and looked at 1 and two bedroom units when they first became available.
