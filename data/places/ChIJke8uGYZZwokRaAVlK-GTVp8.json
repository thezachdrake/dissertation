Recently, I've ventured off my usual haircut service to try a soft perm and was not disappointed. As usual, Kevin delivered on hair that was beautiful and breezy. Despite having Asian hair, the perm has lasted for months as of writing this review and makes it look like I have beach waves with an oomph to the volume without looking like I tried or spent any time styling (which I don't!).
