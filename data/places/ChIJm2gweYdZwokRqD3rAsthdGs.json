Yesterday they had me go to a location to pick up a car that they scheduled only for me to not be able to pick up the car because they created a balance.  A balance that I couldn't clear because I cannot update my payment method.  Today, on the advice of another customer service representative, I went to the bank to move money from one account to another to use another card.  They advised that everything would work.  Everything did NOT work.  The response AGAIN from their team is \"we can't help you\" and \"wait five to ten business days\".  Oh and they're ALWAYS escalating the problem.  The last car I rented they charged me $60 in fraudulent tolls.  It took three different escalations and a total of 20 days for them to clear that up and refund me my money.  Something I do not think they would have done had I not had photos of the odometer before and after my rental, proving I didn't put on the amount of miles necessary to generate all these tolls.  Stay AWAY from this company. I only wish I could give them zero stars."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Zipcar has the worst customer service department I think I've ever encountered.
