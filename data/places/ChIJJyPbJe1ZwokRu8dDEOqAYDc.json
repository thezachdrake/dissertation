Here is the breakdown solely on flavor:\n\nPapri Chaat (3/5): The spice level was great but the papri was very strange... it was super thick and hard and difficult to eat... it didn't soak in the yogurt like it should have\n\nPrawn (4.5/5): The flavor is great. However, even though it looks quite extravagant it's really only 2-3 bites of deliciousness.\n\nPaneer (3/5): The dish itself was pretty oily (similar to a few other dishes judging from other reviews) and there was strong flavors from mace and methi which could be a bit overwhelming in certain bites.\n\nDessert (4/5): Came warm which was unique. I'm used to cool desserts but I loved the burnt edges of this dessert.\n\nI could have excused the food given the excellent service and the vibes. But the price! $14 for the prawn is a bit outlandish. The dessert which was a rice pudding-esque dessert was $12. We ordered a mango lassi and it was $9 (!!?). The raita on the side is also $3.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was good. But I'd rather go to somewhere in Flushing or Jackson Heights to get similar quality food at half or third the price.
