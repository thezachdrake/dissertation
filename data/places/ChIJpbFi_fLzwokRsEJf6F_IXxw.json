However, during this past year, their work has grown to careless and damaging.\n\nFirst, my duvet cover came back with rips (and not just on the seams).  It's not an item that gets frequent washing or hard use.  But nevertheless, I gave Starlight Cleaners the benefit of the doubt.  I wish I had not.\n\nOn December 18 (just before I was leaving town for the holidays), I had my laundry picked up and delivered.  This load included some very expensive light silver/lilac sheets that are only about six months old.  When I got the load back, I started to make my bed with these sheets.  As I was doing so, I noticed discoloration: pink, lightened spots all over the pillowcases as well as on the flat and fitted sheet.  These spots had not been there before.\n\nI immediately called Starlight Cleaners, explaining what had happened and the damage done to my favorite sheets.  Perhaps some bleach or other chemical residue had been in the machine?  The first man was argumentative.  I spoke with the other who was the same.  I offered to text them photos of much of the damage and got a cell number since I was leaving town.  The second man agreed, saying that he'd call me back after he'd seen it.  I immediately sent about six photos in good light and some text further describing the damage/stains.  Nobody called me back.\n\nI called a day or so later and was promised that someone would call me back.  Nobody did.  When I called a third (or was it fourth?) time, I spoke with the man again, who yelled at me.  I told him how much the sheets were (including the discount; who doesn't love a Bed, Bath, and Beyond coupon?) and that he needed to respect a loyal customer and make this right.  He refused.  He didn't even offer to pay for a portion of the sheets that were ruined in Starlight's care, even after I had reminded him how many years I'd used them (and how much money they'd made from me).  I said that I didn't want to have to warn others that their laundry might be destroyed by Starlight Cleaners and that it would be so much easier to work out a solution.  He just kept yelling and refusing to take any responsibility or concern.  So much for \"the customer is always right\" or trying to find a workable solution.  He said he would call me back and hung up.  He never did.\n\nI texted them (the same number to which I had sent the photos of the spotted/ruined sheets that they ignored and refused to recognize) a couple more times between December 21 and 29.  I have received no answer.\n\nIt's not easy to find a company in northern Inwood that will pick up and deliver your wash and fold.  I looked over the first bad experience (the tipped duvet cover) with Starlight for this very reason.  But now that my $275 sheets have been ruined with not even as much as an apology (yep...they never even said \"I'm sorry\"), much less offering to replace or pay for any portion of them), I'm finding a new service.  If you care about your belongings, I would caution you to AVOID Starlight Cleaners at all costs.  The business does not honor or value loyal customers.  They do not exemplify good neighbors.  And not only do they refuse to deal with a customer that they have wronged in a professional manner, they ignore the customer...or yell at the customer when forced to see the damage they've done.\n\nI hate having to speak ill of a local business, but my neighbors deserve better.
