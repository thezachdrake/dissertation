I excitedly ordered a pair of shoes from them, and was so excited to get them in the mail. I ordered my normal size according to the fit instructions on French Sole's site, but they were tight. I wore them around my house for the day to see if I could \"break them in\" - maybe they were just new, I thought.\n\nThe next day it appeared that, nope, they were definitely a size too small. One day after they were delivered, I meticulously repackaged them in all the original packaging to send them back for an exchange per the company's policy. I had to pay an expensive FedEx shipping fee out-of-pocket because the company doesn't offer free returns and exchanges.\n\nFrench Sole then REFUSED to exchange them and basically told me, too bad they don't fit, we're sending the too-small shoes back to you. Apparently, the \"wear and tear\" from me walking from my home office to my kitchen to get coffee for two hours the day I received them meant  \"too much wear\" and they refused the exchange. I'm now stuck with a $160 pair of shoes a size too small, and out $15 from the cost of shipping them back to the company only to have them returned to me.\n\nI'm so disappointed that a supposedly luxury company would treat a customer this way. Every other luxury retailer I've worked with or shopped with would write off the shoes in their inventory and send a pair that fits to the customer - not make them pay for the return shipping, then say \"Too bad\" and send them back the same expensive shoes that don't fit. I was excited to buy more cute shoes from this company, but I'll never, ever shop with them again. After researching the company, I found so many reviews on Yelp and Zappos that the shoes run too small and people were unhappy with them, and also that French Sole pulled the same refusing-an-exchange trick with other people, too. Buyers, beware!\n\nEDITED SEPTEMBER 19: This company is now threatening me with legal action for writing a negative review of their product online. I received the original shoes back today and inspected them again for the \"deep, etched gauges\" and a \"completely worn out sole.\" Yes, there is wear - see attached photo - but this is from walking around the hardwood floors of my house for two hours to see if the shoes needed to be broken in or were just too small, not from \"running on concrete\" as they so condescendingly accused me of doing. Perhaps the shoes themselves should be better made to ensure that a few hours of around-the-house wear doesn't cause immediate wear and tear on the soles on the first day of use?\n\nIt seems from many of the online reviews I've found of this company (wonder if they threatened to sue those people, as well?), they'll find any reason to refuse your return or exchange.\n\nALSO - if you read the fine print of their exchange policy, they charge you $12 shipping and a 15% restocking fee."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"So disappointed in this company.
