This is exactly what happened. Aside from the local anesthetic not being effective and being in pain throughout the whole process, the scar that she “removed” and stitched began to open. I let her know via text, she requested pictures. I told her that I don’t think she ever fully closed it. She never took pictures showing me what was done. And I was informed not to remove the bandage until 3 days after. When I removed it I saw it was wide open. She looked at it after vacation at the follow up appointment, and painfully removed the stitches that were pointlessly there because they did not keep the wound closed at all. She even mentioned if she had to do the procedure again she would do it again. Unfortunately I’m not willing to go through that pain again and I am at this point seeking treatment from other healthcare professionals and would like a refund."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I paid $1500 for the surgical removal of a scar.
