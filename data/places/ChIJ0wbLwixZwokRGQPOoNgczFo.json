Ice Cream!! So tasty! Van Leeuwen Ice Cream is doing a great job with their flavors. They have multiple locations throughout New York and I believe they are continuing to expand throughout the country. And for good reason too! The flavor is so rich and they use high quality ingredients to really make their ice cream shine. The atmosphere of the storefront we went to was bright, bubbly, and welcoming. The only thing I didn't like was the black on the ceiling near the vent as you can see in the pictures. Was a bit of a turn off. The service is counter service and was friendly and helpful. I will be looking for this ice cream shop while traveling the country because it's too good to pass up! Definitely recommend this ice cream shop.\n\nI got a homemade waffle cone with one scoop of Marion Berry Cheesecake ice cream and my wife got a scoop of Brown Sugar Cookie Dough Chunk in a cup. When we ordered, we were told by the cashier that it was Topping Tuesday and that we were able to get one free topping of our choice for each of our ice creams! We had no idea and there wasn't any signs that said that so it was very nice of her to mention that to us! I also got whipped cream on my cone and my wife got Honeycomb Candy bits on hers. To start, my ice cream was amazing! For those that don't know, Marion Berry is a type of Blackberry so it was essentially blackberry cheesecake ice cream but it was so fresh! Tasted like they threw in the while cheesecake and mixed it with their vanilla ice cream. The ice cream base was rich and had swirls of Marion Berry with little chunks of graham cracker crust throughout. The waffle cone that it came in was also fantastic. You could tell it was homemade and not the generic waffle cones that every other ice cream place offers and it's worth the work because the texture was perfect, the spices and vanilla in it was there and you can taste them. The only minor gripe I have is that the whipped cream just tasted like... Whipped. Cream. No sugar or vanilla. I'm not sure if they missed adding that or if that's how it is but definitely not my favorite whipped cream but I appreciate that it was free and homemade. My wife's ice cream was delicious as well with rich brown sugar flavor and a decent amount of cookie dough chunks throughout. I liked her Honeycomb crunch topping that she had on it because it was basically crystalized honey that added a nice crunch texture to the ice cream but also had delicious flavor.\n\nOverall, with the stellar service, cute atmosphere and mind bending ice cream, this is a shop that will forever leave an impression in my mind as one of my favorite ice cream shops in the country so far. Their popularity proves that their doing something right. The price isn't unreasonable considering the quality so try them out!\n\nFood - 4.9 ⭐\nAtmosphere - 4.5 ⭐\nService - 5 ⭐\nOverall - 5 ⭐\n\nFollow me for more reviews across America 😎🍔🍕🍨🍦🦖🔧"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Mmmmmmm!

Let me tell you, they were soooooooooooo good!!!!!!!\n\nAll the cookies was delicious but C&C was DEFINITELY my FAVORITE, it sure didn't let me down!!!!!!\n\nI got C&C on top but after trying them both decided to swap the scoops. Hohohoho!!!\n\nIcecream is on the pricey side, but it's totally worth it and nobody will have it everyday, so it won't hurt you get some every once in a while, it's soooooo worth it!!!!!!\n\nDefinitely reached the Top 6 of my favorite icecream brands. Would love to try more of their seasonal flavors."},"publishTime":"2022-05-03T04:43:17Z"}],"dineIn":true,"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7862089802915,"longitude":-73.9759013697085},"low":{"latitude":40.7835110197085,"longitude":-73.9785993302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":12,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":0,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":12,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":0,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":12,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":0,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":12,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":0,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":12,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":0,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":12,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"truncated":true,"hour":23,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":59}},{"open":{"day":6,"truncated":true,"hour":0,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":1,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":12,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":1,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Tuesday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Wednesday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Thursday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Friday: 12:00 PM – 1:00 AM","Saturday: 12:00 PM – 1:00 AM","Sunday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"448 Amsterdam Ave, New York","servesCoffee":true}
