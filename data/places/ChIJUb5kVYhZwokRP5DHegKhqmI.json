I am so grateful and excited to share my review. I will start off my saying that many years ago, a friend of mine in acting school told me about No 6 clogs.

As you can imagine, I was really sad. So for a while, I just figured I would never wear their shoes. I kept seeing them and wanted them, so I eventually ordered a pair from Farfetch, but alas, I had to return them because once again they were too narrow. I went to the sample sale this summer, ok I am realizing this is literally turning into my life story but I also want to share everything I can so I'm just gonna keep going, anyway, I went to the sample sale this summer, tried on boots, and they were too tight on my left foot. I was so sad. I am such a picky person and when I like something, I love it. Then this winter, they were having a sale, and so I for some reason reached out on instagram and asked if they had this one pair of mule platforms (open toes) that I had literally been eyeing for like 2 years. Maybe 3. Bianca sent them to the store for me. I got in to the store a month and a half later, and they were still there for me!!!! I tried them on, and I kid you not, they were the most comfortable thing ever, felt like I was walking on air. I bought them on the spot, and I just reached out to Bianca to send another pair of a different shoe to the store, and will be going in to the store tomorrow to try them on. I am so impressed with Bianca, how kind and helpful she has been for me! She has made me feel like a cared for customer, and I appreciate that she has gone above and beyond to try and help me with literally all my questions, and sending the shoes to the store on my behalf.

It’s on the pricey end, but everything I’ve ever bought here has lasted many years, so well worth the price in the end. Also, a shout-out to the staff, who are always very helpful (my visit today being no exception)—they’re never pushy and give me all the time on my own that I need, yet when I ask them, they always offer excellent opinions and advice. So grateful that this store exists in-person, not just online!"},"publishTime":"2022-01-05T03:07:36Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7215655802915,"longitude":-73.99621826970849},"low":{"latitude":40.718867619708504,"longitude":-73.9989162302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":12,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":18,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":12,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":18,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":12,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":18,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":12,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":18,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":12,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":18,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":12,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":18,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: Closed","Tuesday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM","Wednesday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM","Thursday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM","Friday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM","Saturday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM","Sunday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"8 Centre Market Pl, New York"}
