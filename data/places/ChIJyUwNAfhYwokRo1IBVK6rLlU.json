I also work out\nregularly now—something I haven’t done in years.\n\nI’ve learned so much about what actual healthy eating is and how different aspects of lifestyle can affect\nmy overall health. I feel empowered to continue living healthier. I’m really grateful for Gabbi and Rakhi’s\nkindness, education, patience, and for keeping me accountable to my health goals. Highly recommend!"},"publishTime":"2023-04-28T22:28:26Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7793632302915,"longitude":-73.97858186970848},"low":{"latitude":40.7766652697085,"longitude":-73.9812798302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":15,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":23,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":15,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":23,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":15,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":23,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":15,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":23,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":15,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":23,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 3:00 – 11:00 PM","Tuesday: 3:00 – 11:00 PM","Wednesday: 3:00 – 11:00 PM","Thursday: 3:00 – 11:00 PM","Friday: Closed","Saturday: Closed","Sunday: 3:00 – 11:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"133 W 72nd St #703, New York"}
