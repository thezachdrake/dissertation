So I called the office staff and they said maybe it didn't go through and that they would fax it again. When I checked in again and again, each time they said they had faxed it. In the past few month or so, I've redirected them to fax it to me instead, but they kept saying they did and then finally they confessed and said it hadn't been completed by the doctor yet.\n\nMy recent requests for the paperwork have been unanswered and my request seems so simple. I keep going in circles with them. I always gave them the benefit of the doubt figuring they were very busy, but being lied to and being told \"they forgot\" is unacceptable customer service.
