Sushi Zen. Sushi Den.

And it’s still the case; reservations, even at 11:30, were difficult.\n\nWe sat at the sushi counter with Uezo-san and his apprentice. Though Kurumazushi isn’t large – it occupies the second floor of a commercial office building – there are tables as well.\n\nKurumazushi does have an Omakase option, but there is no price break at lunch – it’s about $300 for 16 courses as my NYC Omakase list will tell you. If spending $300 for ~90 minutes during the middle of the day isn’t your thing – as it wasn’t for us – consider that there are ways to order fantastic, seasonal sushi a far more reasonable rate.\n\nWe elected to go with the $80, “Sushi Plate”, a seasonal combination of nine nigiri and a makizushi (negitoro on the day we dined), served in two plates.\n\nThe beauty of nigiri is often in its simplicity, and the Chu Toro pictured on my blog is a great example of that. No extra toppings, a little shoyu applied, just the neta formed to the shape of the vinegered rice (as it should be).\n\nThe Sushi Plate features popular year-round Neta like Maguro, Uni and Ikura, but it also had Botan Ebi, an autumn speciality, though unfortunately no tempura heads served as is often custom.\n\nMy first visit to Kurumazushi was long overdue, but it won’t be my last. Every part of the meal – from the location, to the itamae, to the no-frills sushi, expertly prepared at an understandably-higher price point – screams throwback.\n\nDespite the fact that the midday rice put me to sleep during hours of afternoon meetings that could have just been an email, this was worth it.\n\nRecommended."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Believe it or not, but Sushi in New York City actually predates the 2010s.
