Their classes and teachers were WELL worth the commute, so it is an absolute joy to have them in the neighborhood now. It's for good reason that they've continued to expand. So many wonderful and experienced teachers, it would be really hard for me to choose a favorite. Avea Pilates has strengthened and shaped my body like no other, it's been one of the best investments I've made in myself. And it's a pleasure to support a woman-owned business as well!
