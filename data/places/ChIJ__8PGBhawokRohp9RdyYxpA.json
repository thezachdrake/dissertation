Years ago I remember when James convinced me to sign on a property in what was literally an unknown area of NYC on the west side of Manhattan. \"Trust me, this is a great deal and you would be a fool to pass it up\", he said. This decision would turn out to be an amazing housing decision, in what would later become The Hudson Yards. James guided me through my anxiety and fear and let me know that I was making the correct decision in choosing my first home in New York. This was some of the most sound advice I received in my early adult life, which set me up for future success. Manhattan real estate is unbelievably competitive and having someone who knows the market, knows how to negotiate, and always looks after your interest first is wildly valuable.
