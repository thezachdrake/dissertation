I had no idea just how influential the photographer is an orchestrating the big day, and I thank my lucky stars that I ended up with a photographer as professional, detail oriented, and talented as Asher. First, I just fell in love with her style. I'm obsessed with the natural light and bright and airy feel of her photos. She does an amazing job of capturing the little details of the day as well as capturing the candid \"in between\" moments that in my opinion, are even more beautiful than the staged photos. My husband and I were in constant communication with Asher during the wedding planning process and I found myself turning to Asher for advice and guidance on so many different aspects of the wedding such as how the flowers would photograph, how handle the sometimes complicated nuances of family photos, chatting about the timeline and our goals. She was almost like a mentor through the entire planning process which meant so much to us. By the time our big day came, my husband and I already felt like close friends with her. As a bride, you're actually spending most of your wedding day with the photographer and again, I was so grateful that Asher was as wonderful as she is because I didn't realize just how much time we'd be spending together on the wedding day. The second photographer and assistant Asher brought with her were equally as wonderful. During our first look I was STARVING and her assistant gave me the granola bar out of her purse. So sweet and thoughtful! We also had a few unexpected challenges come up - including a parade that was blocking our entrance to the first look and unpredicted rain. Asher handled these challenges with grace and was never panicked or stressed which also kept my calm. At the end of the night when it came time for her and her staff to leave, my husband and I were sad to say goodbye.
