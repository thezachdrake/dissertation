We ordered the mini dutch pancakes. I highly recommend them. So small, so fully of flavor. The bananas are a perfect compliment. I do wish they would serve syrup along side it. There can be three or so mini pancakes with no topping so i personally would of love to add extra syrup to the pancakes.\n\nWe also got the skillet eggs with bacon and scallion. I also love this dish. Its eggs in a cute small skillet with crumbled pieces of bacon and a big handful of scallion. I wish the eggs were kept a little runnier but i understand that its hard to stop the cooking when the skillet itself gets really hot as well. The eggs are served with a couple of pieces of bread and butter on the side. Since the skillet is hot, i personally enjoy heating up the bread and butter on the pan.\n\nTo drink i got the iced latte. It's pretty good. I appreciate that it wasn't light. The coffee taste and flavor was still never strong despite all the milk added with lattes. My daughter got the hot chocolate. It was okay. I feel like it needed more chocolate. We had to add way too much sugar because it originally tasted like warm milk.\n\nDuring my prior visits, i was able to get good seats at a booth. This time i had to sit at the long table instead. It was okayy, an experience. We shared the table with three other parties of two/three. The layout of this place is a little off some. I almost wish there was more space. The decor here is simple but beautiful. Almost farm chic or so.\n\nThe staff here is friendly and easy going.
