Apart from my doctors request to exercise to help my osteoporosis, I wanted a change and not let age or being out of shape get to me.\n\nIn the past i went to several celebrity and top rated trainers from LA to Hong Kong and did not see any major results.  This time around i wanted a professional athlete who aims for results and had a set record. I chose Ngo Okafor for two main reasons: he is a professional golden box winner x2  and has a stellar attitude for results and no nonsense.  I went to Iconoclast gym and visually vouched the result of the one man who underwent the 28 day transformation (i.e the one shown on the website).  Seeing is believing and what a gorgeous body this man has.   I immediately signed up for the 28 day day transformation with Ngo Okafor and saw results in 12 days.  Overall i became toned and got down to a healthy weight with muscles in the right areas.  Did i lose my flab? Yes i definitely got my stomach and waist in svelte form.   I was extremely happy with what i achieved.  It takes hard work and Ngo is one who pushes hard for your goals.\n\nAfter a couple months I had to stop training given my father passed away and my mother had cancer and my world seemed to be caving in.  During this intense time, the training Ngo gave me prepared me to deal with the trauma physically and mentally in such a positive way.  Nothing in life prepares you for the loss but with this prior training it gave me stamina spiritually and physically.  During and after the storm of my loss, Ngo was mentoring me.  Presently, Ngo is still very much my mentor and personal trainer. I attend personal training every day now as part of my daily regime and as an investment on my body, mind and health.  I decided to scale back on other vices and put it into something long term for not just looking good but for my health.\n\nThe Iconoclast gym is a gem hidden in Madison Square. Upon entering you feel the zen and the privacy it gives. There's a room for just weights, cardio machines, shower rooms, and stretch areas.  I love especially the one room where you walk into a gorgeous green football field covering.\n\nI believe in sharing wonderful things in life whether it be great restaurants, hero products, shows etc.   This is one trainer i highly recommend.   To this end, I want to thank truly Ngo for all he has done.
