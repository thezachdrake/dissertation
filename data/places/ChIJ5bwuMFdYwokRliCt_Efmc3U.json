As previous reviewers have mentioned, the pizzas are pretty wet. However, I have an oil sensitivity and it was not triggered here, so it must have not been too bad. Personally, their ratios are a bit off to me. The pizza is so thin (which probably contributes to the wet issue), and the rest of the dough seems to be put into the crust. I would prefer a more even split, especially because parts of the crust were charred. For flavors, the margherita did not taste like the standard. It was salty and the freshness of the basil and mozzarella were not coming through. My friend's white pizza had significantly better flavors!\n\nService here was amazing! Everyone was extremely attentive, even when they started getting busy. Our water was constantly refilled. They were also extremely quick to clear plates, although that could make people feel rushed. Some people mentioned their high price point, but I feel like they are comparable with other places in the city.
