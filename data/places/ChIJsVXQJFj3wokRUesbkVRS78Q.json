IKEA’s installation service refused to touch this project. To complicate everything, I choose dark gray panels and shiny white cabinet doors. Meaning, anything that’s not perfect will easily be seen.\n\nEric came a day early prior to the start date to review the kitchen plan with me. He was not only unfazed by the technical challenges, but quickly saw errors in the IKEA plan and expertly rearranged all the cabinets on the fly. With these changes came needing additional cabinet parts, which he went personally to IKEA to pick up for me. Throughout the entire project he came reliably on time every day, was a perfectionist, and did additional IKEA runs as needed. Everything was done on time, on budget, and without a single blip to mention. Anything I mentioned as a request was happily discussed and no concern was too small for him to handle with finesse.\n\nAfter the project finished and my appliances were installed, I asked if he could come back and put one last filler piece above the fridge. He did not hesitate to return promptly - even though he was already paid in full -  to add this small detail.\n\nJust fabulous."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is my first time leaving a review.
