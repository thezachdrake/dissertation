It all reached a climax last night when I woke up to a gigantic cockroach crawling on my face.

Greenwich Hall is truly a HEALTH HAZARD. The living conditions are poor with eight people in the average apartment-- two triples and a double. In the 8-person apartments, there is a flex room with the double having a 3x7 hole in the wall up to the ceiling. The hallway constantly smells of vomit and burning wire. The apartments are decrepit with broken stoves, no microwaves or sunlight. For the average college student doing a summer 10-week internship (the majority of renters), it costs an exorbitant $3250 and upwards to live there. Due to the poor quality of the housing, I have been consistently staying with a friend.\n\nIt is safe to say that the sidewalks are cleaner and have fewer roaches than our NYU apartment. We are supposed to have a complimentary biweekly 15-minute common space cleaning service (unique to Greenwich Hall, likely because of the critters), which has never actually conducted service due to \"elevator issues\" in the building. The elevators break down at least twice a week. Unfortunately, these apartments are wildly popular among unaware interns looking for the ability to rent on a per-week basis, have access to NYU services, and a responsive building staff. In fact, companies such as CitiBank block out rooms in the building for their interns. The declining quality of NYU dorms and the rampant exploitation of students and summer renters alike only grows, and I want unwitting potential renters to know to avoid this place."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"NYU's Greenwich Hall at 636 Greenwich Street is infested with roaches.
