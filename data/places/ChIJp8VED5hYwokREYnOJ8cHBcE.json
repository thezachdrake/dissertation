Since we became familiar with symptoms of septic shock symptoms, we immediately would rushed her to the intensive care unit, to be given strong antibiotics to save her life.  This took a terrible toll on her.\n\nFortunately, we took her to Dr. Young for treatment. Dr, Young did an amazing intervention and Irma reacted very well to his treatment.
