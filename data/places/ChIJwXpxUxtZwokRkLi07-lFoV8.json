Never once did they try to \" up sell\" me on any products or services, but instead kept to the budget and supplied me with cost-cutting options if I wanted them. Brehmn's expertise in renovating historic properties in New York City is one of their many specialties. Brehm's business card says General Contractors, but I feel they are so much more. At times they acted as an architect deciding to move a doorway to get more space for the kitchen. To hire an architect could have been an expensive add on, but their experienced eyes led them to that perfect solution. Other times they acted as an interior designer, creating custom cabinetry and built ins that personalized my apartment. Still other times they became interior decorators helping me choose the perfect paint color of a pale blue gray and then seemingly floating it onto the walls.
