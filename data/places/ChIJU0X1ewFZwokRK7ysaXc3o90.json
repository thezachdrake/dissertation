I stopped by the store to let them know and was told that it’s my fault and I should take it to the tailor to fix. I was upset by the poor quality and response but let it slide.

I did and the woman was kind and let me know I need to speak to her manager who’d call me. He never did. I called only for him to let me know rudely that it isn’t their fault, zippers break. After much back and forth he promised to get back to me. He never did. In the end they refused to stand behind the product to either help fix it or give some store credit for their faulty product (not even talking abt a return or refund).
