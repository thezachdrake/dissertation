Wanted to get in some cardio and sightseeing. Trust me! This pier needs to be on your bucket list of NYC locations to visit. The view is simply gorgeous. Tribeca has always been one of my favorite areas to come visit during the summer. As a Borough of Manhattan College Alumni graduate; I have spent many of spring & summer mornings gazing out into the sky and watching the cruise lines + yachts. There are restaurants available on the pier, as well as many within the area. There is a Whole Foods very close by if you want to grab some treats, and beverages to keep you hydrated before heading over to the pier. You can bring a small blanket if you like to lay out in the grass or sit in one of the many designated areas filled with benches to enjoy the scenery. This pier is absolutely kid friendly! In fact many of the summer programs within NYC use areas throughout the pier to engage children in outdoor learning activities. This is pier is baby friendly as well; and depending on the time & day- you will see activities with parents and small children engaging in “learning through play” and other bonding resources for families. The area is very safe and the pier also has restrooms incase you’re worried about that. There is minor construction taking place as they expand the pier; however it won’t interfere with. Whenever I go to this area I typically spend my entire day because it’s so relaxing and rejuvenating. You will see all walks of life; from physical fitness, skateboarding, volleyball, miniature golf, sunbathing, and much more. Lots of space to run, and explore. To reach this pier you can take the 1,2,3 trains to chambers street and then walk. There is also other means of transportation to reach the pier such as port authority and it’s directly off the west side highway."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Had a fantastic solo visit yesterday.
