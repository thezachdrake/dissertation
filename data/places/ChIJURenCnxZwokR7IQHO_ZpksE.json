Froom my past experience I have experience the repair person to either spray or polish a shoe once complete. On top of the dusty appearance , the shoe had black glue all over the heel , to the point where there was no longer any suede shown on the bottom, in addition there was a piece of suede that I was told could be covered and it wasn't, there was also a piece on the top that I was told could be fixed. He said give him a bit more time which i did , this time I left and returned 30 mins later.  I returned to the same dusty shoe , that still wasn't sprayed and had the same tear on the top.
