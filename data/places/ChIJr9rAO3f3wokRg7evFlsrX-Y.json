I had the pancakes which came with candied plantains, the plantains were a bit too hard for me to chew but the pancakes were fluffy and made to perfection. My only gripe was there were no lattes nor cappuccino. This felt like a place that should have that but they do serve an assortment of teas. The jerk chicken sausage was soo good.
