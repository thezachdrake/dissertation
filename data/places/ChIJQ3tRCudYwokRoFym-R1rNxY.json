Getting a Brazilian wax hurt less! The lady doing my facial kept saying “beauty is pain” and chuckling at the fact that I was in pain. She literally asked me if I have kids because if I did, I wouldn’t be in as much pain as I am. She was aggressive, pushy & not gentle AT ALL. I was in literal tears (not the normal ones for extractions). She did not care, she didn’t try to soothe me in any way at all.
