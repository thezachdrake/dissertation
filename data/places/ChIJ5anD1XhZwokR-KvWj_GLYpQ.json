There are about 15 apartments that moved out recently and doorman told me that people are leaving because apartments are overpriced and you get old appliances, water damaged walls and floors, my tub stopper after multiple visits never worked in the 2 years I was there, washing machine I was told will be checked but never was in the 2 YEARS I WAS THERE, it would sometimes work and sometimes wouldn't, wall paint was falling off all over the apartment and I asked them multiple times (I have emails to prove) to come and check on paint since I have 2 little kids, noone ever did. Owner of the building just doesn't care. Even doorman said so, people who were working there for 40+ years say it's really sad it has come to this.

They just care to take your money, but what they give you is urine smelled entrance at ALL TIMES since dogs all pee right when you exit your home and when you enter your home, poorly maintained and dirty all over the place and all they post on Street Easy and Zillow are not current photos, they are all old photos from when the building was new and maintained properly.\nI work with many buildings in the area and they all say that Yorkshire Towers is known to have one of the worst managements which is visible in the way building is maintained for sure.... Oh well, now I have heat I control myself, super who comes for every little problem and he comes right away, no mice/dead rats/garbage around the building, and don't give them extra $60K a year for nothing....their loss.
