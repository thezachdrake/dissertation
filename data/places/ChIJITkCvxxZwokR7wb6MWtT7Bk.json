The fried calamari was fantastic - the rings were crispy with good batter and the marinara sauce was fresh with a nice spicy kick. The wine list is also huge and their lemondrops do not disappoint! They made them with minimal sugar and they were not stingy on shots . The server was so friendly, attentive and knew the menu very well with how to pair accordingly with drinks and sauces. They even heated up the sides ( creamed spinach and thick cut fries were to die for) several times with no problems ( we loved this place so much we sat over 3 hours!). The steak was juicy well seasoned with perfect cuts and the peppercorn sauce we ordered was fresh; the manager himself delivered it to us. I also was so happy that the restaurant gave us complimentary champagne when they found out we were engaged couple, very sweet and caring. PS the nyc cheesecake does not disappoint- the graham crust was perfect in texture and the cheesecake was thick with yummy strawberries and cream . The coffee here is also strong just the way I like it: for all this amazing food drinks dessert and topnotch service at only $400 this place cant be beat. Only thing that holds me back from 5 stars is that each side is ala carte as opposed to being included with your meat; they probably can invent a dish that includes everything together."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This place is a gem.
