There were three people ahead of me. I then waited for an hour to be seen. Meanwhile, I noticed several people who arrived after me had come and gone. I asked the woman at the desk why people who came in after me had been called first and had left. She asked for my name and birth date, and after checking her list flatly said, “You were checked out.”\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n“You’ve already been seen by the doctor and you’ve been signed out.”\n\nMy head almost exploded. “I’ve been sitting in that chair for an hour waiting to be seen.” She replied, “Well, you’ve been seen by the doctor and you’ve been checked out.”\n\nExCUSE me??\n\n“I haven’t been seen by ANYONE. How are you going to tell me that I’ve been seen, if I’ve been sitting in that chair for almost an hour? Why would I tell you that I’m waiting to be seen?”\n\nShe responded again, “Well, you’ve already been checked out.”\n\n“Did you SEE me go back there to be seen? Did you see me return?”\n\nAt this point, another woman at the desk went to get someone to verify I was seen. When she returned with two men (I assumed one was a doctor and one was a medical assistant), they both looked confused. SHE looked up my birth date and appeared confused. The younger man, who I assumed was the medical assistant, decided to be proactive and asked me to follow him to a treatment room.\n\nIn the exam room, he apologized for the confusion. He said my name was called and someone else responded and was taken in to be seen. I was incredulous. First, I never heard my name called. I asked, “How is it possible that the wrong person was brought to the exam room and no one noticed? How is it that no one realized, ‘This is not the person we called?’ When I see my primary, every time someone walks into the room they ask for my name and birth date.”\n\nHe didn’t have an answer. He again apologized for the confusion.\n\nBesides the insanity of taking in another patient under the wrong name, I am concerned that their medical information somehow gets incorporated into mine or vice versa. Is my medical insurance now somehow conflated with this random person?\n\nI had gone to the CityMD  because I needed a lab verified negative Covid test, and I wanted to be checked out for another issue while I was there. At this point, I had no trust that the latter would be handled properly and I honestly just wanted to get out of there. I had them run the test, but I was livid from the experience.\n\nThis is not a location I will ever return to. Frankly, I’m not sure that I will use a CityMD again. This used to be a reliable place for professional, immediate medical attention. However, if this is an example of the current protocol - nope. It is understandable if there is a mistake in the patient queue, but if you cannot verify that you have the correct patient in front of you, a BASIC part of patient care - that is totally irresponsible and unacceptable."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I checked in at the kiosk after speaking with someone at the front desk.
