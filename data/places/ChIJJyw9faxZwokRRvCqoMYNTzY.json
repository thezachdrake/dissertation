Building seems to have been poorly constructed and also poorly managed at times.\n\nMy apartment has insulation issues. As the cold NY weather started, I immediately began having cold draft issues which may be due to poor construction / design flaws. The floors are slanted causing the floor molding to leave gaps in areas where there is cold draft coming in from outside. This is not only making it very cold in the apartment but also increasing the cost of heat, which uses electric. I have had the building engineer come multiple times to try to handle but they had limited solutions that were not very helpful. I ultimately had self-resolved this by using insulation tape and insulation foam tape around the windows, heating unit and floor molding throughout the apartment. When you pay almost $3k a month, you do not expect this type of issue, especially in building marketing itself as a luxury building.\n\n(Update: this has been resolved- see all the way at the bottom) On the first day of parking in private lot, their team called for a tow of my car. There was a misunderstanding over number parking spots but it was clear I had paid and when I went sort out the issues, the management company came up with this bogus explanation for what happen. Truth is, because I trusted that when I paid for the spot 2 and half weeks in advance of parking, this management team have controls in place to share the information needed with me but they never sent me a lease and I listened to their assistant on where my spot was without requiring them to give me documents caused the issue. Now they are saying it's policy to tow/ not trying to cure any of this. They have now sent me a lease and ask me to sign, but have said they don't want pay for the towing cost.\n\nI recommend if you are coming to see this any apartment, come during the winter on a cold day and talk to tenants.\n\nCoffee machine in the lounge is broken going on a few weeks. Elevators have been having issues, not working, there is not even a sign on the back elevator letting tenants know it is shut down, which would seem a basic/obvious thing to do. Two guys fought in the lobby on Jan 1, 2023, with one pulling out a machete. Con Edison sent an email to all who live in the building saying that they were going to cut the electricity in all the building's common areas because the building hadn't paid its electric bill.\n\nParking is an issue in the local area here, NYC traffic targets this local area very heavily. They wait outside starting around 7am to ticket vehicles parked on the street.\n\nAs of today, I feel like you can find a higher quality living experience for this amount of money elsewhere in queens / broader NY.\n\n**Update: Upping to 2 stars review since they have resolve the parking mix up and cost of towing of my car. Acting like you care about tenants is the most important thing in my mind, no amount of amenities or lip service is above that.
