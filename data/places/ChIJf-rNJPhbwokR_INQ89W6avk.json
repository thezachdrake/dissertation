I came into Muay Thai and BJJ intimidated as someone with no experience, but Rich, Gianna, Jin, and Chris each went out of their way as coaches to make me feel comfortable and safe, while still pushing me to be better. They’re experts in what they do, and on top of that they're phenomenal teachers who can explain things in a way that makes sense to a day one beginner (and I know I can always ask questions if I didn’t get something initially). The gym has fostered a warm, easygoing, welcoming community overall (with a good amount of women at that!), from novices to actual fighters, who are all equally eager to help you thrive.
