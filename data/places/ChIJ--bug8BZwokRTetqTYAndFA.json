I have never had anyone pay more attention to detail and impart such care into a haircut. She and Shanaya (unsure of spelling) who shampooed my hair also took great care to make sure that I learned how to replicate these results when at home. I learned all about dry shampooing, conditioning in sections, de-tangling as a slow deliberate process, and achieving a defined wash-and-go.
