After 8 months and over $13k we’re still sleeping with eyeshades on with zero compensation or apology for our frustration. The design process with Danielle was awful: multiple iterations, I thought our parameters were very clear, but each time when approving the design, a real blocker would come up that Danielle had failed to mention earlier, like the window wouldn’t open, or this doesn’t come in blackout even though it was our P0. Just awful. Then the wait to receive the blinds in the mail after which you self schedule the installation (so more waiting, about 2-3 weeks). Three blinds were manufactured wrong, another 2 installed the wrong way around, and another had the wrong chain color (sounds silly but they make you pick the metal and if one blind arrives with the wrong color of this metal, it stands out). So more waiting and sleeping with eyeshades. Blinds arrive, self schedule, more waiting. Then one blind stopped working. Self schedule the repair appointment, 3 week wait. They fix the knot in the string inside the blind, apparently, but the fix lasted only 4 days and this time the blind stopped working and came crashing down. At this point Danielle has moved on and is ignoring our emails so I have to call the store who refer us to customer service. Another appointment to fix even though I asked for a replacement given the previous failed fix. More waiting for the appointment, then the technician is not able to fix the blind and refers us to customer service. More phone calls and waiting. Another appointment to “pick up the blind”, it is now apparently in Florida being fixed with no ETA when it will arrive and be reinstalled. I assume more waiting. They sent a replacement paper blind in the meantime but it’s the wrong size so only partially covers the window and we need to sleep with eyeshades. Zero accountability, no following up on the promises made over the phone (like replace not fix the blind, like update the email thread so we have a written record of where we are, like expedite the process). I feel completely defeated, I have no trust once the blind arrives it will not break again. The product seems so flimsy (the string specifically) that I’m expecting the other blinds to stop working at some point too. When they do I will probably just cut my losses and redo the window treatments with a better company- I’ve decided to write this review so others don’t have to go through this."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Avoid, what a waste of money and time.
