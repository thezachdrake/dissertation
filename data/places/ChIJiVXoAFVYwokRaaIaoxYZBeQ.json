The restaurant is located in the Marriott Hotel on the top floor. We took the elevator all the way up; it was crazy, went up so high our ears popped. (47 Stories above Times Square) Upon arrival they welcomed us with a glass of champagne. They told us to arrive 15 minutes earlier and we were there about 8 minutes after. Some people had gotten small bites of food but our group didn’t receive any. We waited in a small room before going into the main dining area. We were able to take pictures but the lighting inside wasn't the most flattering.\n\nSoon after they escorted us one by one to our tables. They gave us bread rolls with olive oil and butter. The butter they gave was a bit ghetto. They kept it in the packaging like they would at a basic diner. The bread looked good but tasted stale. We asked the server to get us a new batch. The lights went a little dim and the show started. We all had our own individual projection screens pointing at our table. Before every course the (mini animated chef) would prepare the food in front of us. Each course felt like it had a 5 minute show. The first course was Burrata and Maple Kabocha. Presentation was very pretty, the burrata was good, and I especially enjoyed the mini balls of what tasted like vinegary/sweet flavor. The only thing was that it was very simple. For the price they are charging per person there should have been a little more to the plate. They sliced up plain apples and frisee with no dressing on it like rabbit food. Each course got paired with a specific wine, the one they gave us paired very well with the salad.\n\nThe second course was Maine Lobster Risotto. Show was cool; I loved how immediately after the show ended the servers came out ready. The risotto unfortunately was cold and had a small portion. I could honestly say we finished the entire plate in 3-4 bites. After they served the risotto a server came around to the whole restaurant with black pepper. By the time he came to our table to ask us if we wanted any, we were already done. The taste was good but nothing special, maybe i’m just not a lobster person. The wine they served with this course also paired very well.\n\nThe third course (MY FAV) was Beef Short Ribs. Meat was so soft there was no need to use a knife. Everything on my plate was very tasty, especially the sauce they put on top. I wish there was more. The only thing they could have kept off of our plates were the charred broccolini. Left a bad bitter taste in my mouth so we pushed those to the side. Compared to the other two courses this was a better sized portion. They also served a great red wine to pair with the steak.\n\nFor dessert which was my second fave they gave a deconstructed mix of different items. It was a Matcha Coconut Espresso Fusion. In the bowl there were small pieces of chocolate, ice cream, crunchy coconut, marshmallow, matcha, raspberry and topped off with a warm espresso ganache. Was plated beautifully in a clear glass bowl. They even came out with a candle and Happy Birthday written on my plate.\n\nAll in all it was a very different and cool experience. I’ve always wanted to come to a restaurant like this so I was happy I got to try it. The servers were very sweet and attentive. They even offered to take pictures of us together throughout the night. Would I be back? Probably not. The price you're paying is not worth the food you're eating. We left there pretty hungry still. Also wish the lighting inside was a bit darker so you can enjoy the presentation more. Still appreciated the show and effort.\n\nP.S.
