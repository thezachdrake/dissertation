It took this company 26 hours for a 2-3 hour job. Breaker for my apartment went bad was left with no electricity for 26 hours because of this company. Called aardvark when their website clearly states FREE ESTIMATES with 1 HOUR EMERGENCY SERVICE. I admit i was desperate and foolish so i waited for them for 2.45 hours. Paid $156 for the electrician look at the problem and was quoted $40 dollars for every 1/2 hour after plus tax and materials. Electrician shows up takes a look brings the wrong tools and asks ME for a set of Allen keys because he didn't have the right tools for the job. Folks if an electrician asks YOU for a tool thats when you know you made a mistake.  I spent that whole day with no electricity because of the electrician they sent me never contacted my electrical company in time to take the meter off that was blocking the breaker. At 10am the next day he comes and finishes the work at around 3pm. After complaining to management they defended their worker as they should but offered no help. Absolutely the most rude woman at the reception desk claiming that she will see me in court. Total bill for replacing a breaker $525.32. Thats the $156 for FREE ESTIMATE 2.0 hours of labor + $103 for the breaker + tax. After making my mistake I received quoted from other licensed electricians which offer the same job for $200 less than what is being asked of me to pay. PRICE GOUGING. URGENCY IS NOT IN THIS COMPANIES VOCABULARY, NO ONE CARES NOBODY FOLLOWS UP. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"First and last mistake i will ever make.
