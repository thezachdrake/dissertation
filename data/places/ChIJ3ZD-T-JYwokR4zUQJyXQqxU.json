It's a relatively small congregation, but everyone looks out for one another and works seamlessly together. It's a traditional kind of church, the Episcopal church of years gone by with all its formality. And yet, there is something fresh and different about this church. You can feel the genuineness of the people, the rectors, and the church when you walk in the doors. The music is fantastic, and you'll be surprised how Bernadette Hoke, the Music Director, can make a choir of five sound so complete and beautiful.\n\nI particularly enjoy the sermons from Rev. Matt Harrington, who employs the congregation to read the Bible exactly as it was written, no need for interpretations. He has his finger on the pulse of this congregation, knows each member well and their individual circumstances.  He has the unique ability to pull the whole group together with his upbeat personality, welcoming sense, and his dry wit. That said, he's very much that \"old school\" minister, the kind of minister we all wish we still had. That's him, day in and day out. Communion is beautiful and just feels right.  Weekly Bible Study is conducted by Dr. Dennis Wermert, which always challenges us to broaden our views while confirming our beliefs as solid Christians. Dr. Wermert and Tim Meadows occasionally alternate in preaching the sermons when Rev. Harrington is off visiting other churches in the Diocese. Equally interesting sermons, very uplifting."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is a great church, one where everyone is welcome and there are no strangers.
