The series of events that unfolded during the trip were not only highly inconvenient but also demonstrated a complete disregard for customer service and basic human decency.\nTo begin with, we purchased two tickets for the trip, as my daughter, who had an important orchestra performance in New York City. Knowing that she needed to bring her violin along, we were shocked when the bus driver of bus number 3518 displayed an unprofessional and rude attitude towards us right from the start. He vehemently refused to allow us to bring the violin on board, even though we explained the delicate nature of the instrument and the urgency of the performance.\nDespite our insistence that we had the right to bring our personal belongings on the bus, the driver threatened us with denial of boarding. Feeling cornered and left with no choice, we reluctantly placed the violin beneath the luggage bay. However, when the bus made a stop, I politely approached the driver once again, inquiring if it would be possible to place the violin case in the compartment above our seat. Instead of addressing the matter with professionalism, the driver responded rudely, threatening to expel us from the bus.\nIt is important to note that there was ample space available beneath our seat, which would have allowed us to keep the violin safe. However, the driver denied us this reasonable request and continued to exhibit impatience, speeding, and honking at other vehicles throughout the journey. When I attempted to remind him of the company policy, he dismissively informed me that he had no interest in hearing about it, displaying a complete lack of respect for his responsibilities.\nThe ordeal reached its peak when the bus stopped in New Jersey, and the driver hastily instructed everyone to switch to another bus. This sudden change created further inconvenience, as we were required to reload our luggage onto the new bus. When I approached the new driver and explained the previous driver's refusal to allow me to retrieve the violin, he confirmed that he had received instructions to deny my request. To seek a resolution, I politely requested a pass from the new driver, only to be confronted once again by the previous driver, who threatened to have me removed from the bus.\nThis relentless display of unprofessionalism, rudeness, and abuse of power was utterly unacceptable. I firmly reminded the driver that his actions were unlawful and that I would pursue legal action if necessary. Nevertheless, he proceeded to escalate the situation further by summoning the police and fabricating a different version of events. As a result, I was forcibly removed from the bus in the middle of nowhere, leaving my daughter and me feeling humiliated and stranded.\nFurthermore, my attempts to contact your customer service department during and after the incident were met with complete silence.\nThe mistreatment we endured throughout this experience is not only deeply distressing but also a reflection of the overall lack of professionalism and consideration within your organization. As a customer, I expected a certain level of service and respect, which was sorely lacking.\n\nThis is the Booking Ref: GB2324903, if you want to investigate this incident. What bus company would leave their customers on the side of the road. No one would want to ride if they know the driver has a road rage problem. And during whole incident, the violin case is in the bus luggage bay, all I did was to ask the second shift driver if it is possible for me to bring it up the bus and placed under front seat. I can’t believe a bus company would hire such driver for employment, you are actually putting all the riders at risk.\n\nBooking Ref: GB2325584 (this is the return tickets that we would never use)"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Strong Complaint Regarding Inhumane Treatment by Bus Driver and Nonexistent Customer Service\n\nI am writing this to express my extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment with the experience my daughter and I had while traveling on one of your buses to New York City today.
