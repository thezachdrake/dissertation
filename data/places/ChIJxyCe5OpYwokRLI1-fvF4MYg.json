The (original) owner used to shop with me at a store that I worked at in SoHo years ago….when he was just opening some locations in NYC.  I’ve noticed overtime that the quality of service has gone down a little. After reading through the reviews of late at this location and some of the other locations, I don’t feel as bad about leaving this review.\n\nThe employees aren’t super thrilled with their jobs. I kind of chalked that up to the way everybody seems to be lately. Today I went into the location that I’m writing the review about and  the girl who took my order really didn’t want to be bothered.  She was visibly not thrilled that I ordered sandwiches. After I placed my order, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and I used the hand dryer to dry my hands until they were completely dry because it’s cold out so I wanted to warm up a little bit anyways.  Time passed. When I came back out someone else was placing an order with the same employee I ordered with. The other employee was making a single sandwich for someone who ordered before me. When he was done, he did not start my order he walked away, and then checked his phone….Did a couple little things here and there. After the girl who took my order took that second person‘s order, she went to her phone send some texts or whatever it is that she needed to do. When she was finished she started making the smoothie for the girl who ordered after me. Then she started making the sandwiches….she made the sandwich for the person who ordered after me before my two sandwiches. Anyway for a place that wasn’t very busy I felt like I had to wait a long time and endure a kind of attitude from people that makes you not want to go back.  Plus the quality of the sandwiches was off.  The tuna was all stuffed on one end kind of messy, very different from what I’m used to coming from this place. I would say that this is the worst experience that I’ve had at Joe & the juice.  I feel like some training could happen for the employees to learn how to multitask and start one order as you’re finishing another.  Or work as a team. I don’t know.\n\nI felt very uncomfortable being there, and like I was disrupting lives by placing an order.  I get it. it’s not anybody’s dream career, but as someone who’s worked in the service industry before getting into my career, I fully understood that the customers that came into the restaurants/cafes were the people that were supporting my paycheck.  I did what I could to help them.  obviously I don’t think that means that if a customer is a jerk that a service person should have to cater to that jerk but if someone comes in and is genuinely nice or indifferent, they shouldn’t get treated like they shouldn’t be there and they shouldn’t be ordering because at the end of the day, the customers of her and paying for the products and the paychecks."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve always been a big fan of Joe and the juice.
