My favorite thing was the hanger burger. The burger was cooked perfectly medium-rare, which has been a rare thing to find these days. The meat was juicy and flavored well and the arugula complemented it nicely. Because the BEC and the smash burger have thinner patties, they end up tasting less juicy but still delicious! I was pleasantly surprised to say that the burgers are worth the price! However, I would pass on the onion rings the next time I return. The breading was not crispy and reminded me of soft shrimp tempura batter. There was also no flavor.\n\nService was average.
