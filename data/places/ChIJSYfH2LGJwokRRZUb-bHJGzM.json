COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY USELESS WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ISSUES. I went to see Dr. Harris Nagler on the advice of both fellow physicians and the appointment staff at Northwell Health for the particular symptoms I have. When I went to my appointment, I made sure to bring my paperwork from previous doctors so he could see the tests I had already taken and the corresponding results so he would have an idea of what was happening with me. When I hand him the paperwork and explain what it is, he literally tells me, \"I'm sorry, I'm not going to read all that,\" and starts laughing. I'm not suggesting he read every single word, but at least glance through the papers, get an idea of what is going on. If it was you who were ill and needed help, wouldn't you want your doctor to take a few minutes and look through your file? I've been to doctors before who at least reviewed what I gave them. Would it cost so much to at least TRY TO HELP??? Or at the very least, don't LAUGH about it. You have someone who is in pain sitting in front of you, and you're laughing as if it's all a joke. The remainder of my visit was a series of, \"I don't know how to help you...,\" and insulting suggestions that my symptoms were all in my head. And this was all during my first appointment, without him either reading my paperwork or even performing a single test on me. He looks professional and his credentials all are good, but it's just an image. I really have never been treated this way by a doctor before and I would never recommend anyone who cares about their health to see him either."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"HORRIBLE DOCTOR ! ! !
