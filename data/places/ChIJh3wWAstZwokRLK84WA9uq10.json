There aren’t many coffee shops around the block so it was a great place to attract all demographics.  The interior is classy and I love the gold and marble finish with coffee preparation area as a donut shape.  We ordered two drip coffees so I thought it would be the fastest take out item on the menu as we were rushing to the station.  After waiting for five minutes I started to notice how unorganized the staff were- the manager looking individual was raising her voice to the other staff who were mixing up the orders which emitted some aggressive energy.  The staff who were serving the people who stayed  had no idea which drink was for which table and kept coming back to the manager for confirmation.  I strongly believe there needs to be coordination amongst the staff and definitely more training. Roles and responsibilities seemed to be less transparent.  Also they should really get rid of tracking orders through paper receipts if they were mixing up orders.  I was surprised to end up waiting 20-25 min on the simple drip coffee.  The manager mixed up our order with another order who had the same name.  If they cant get the orders right, suggest switching to numbers…\n\nAfter this event, I was finally excited to try the coffee. Not sure if it was because it was made in such a rush, it tasted very bitter with no aroma - after letting it breathe I finally started to taste the true flavor of the coffee.\n\nI hope the owner and manager improves its operations and training so there will be more re-occurring customers"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve noticed this place open up recently and was very excited to try their Italian roasted coffee.
