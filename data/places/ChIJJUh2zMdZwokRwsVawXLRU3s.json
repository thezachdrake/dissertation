The front windows are welcoming and you clearly get the vibe once you enter the space, which is filled with awesome music and friendly staff.  I ate a few times in the back room and once in the 6-top up front and was just as happy in either room.  I would consider myself a low key “foodie” so I was really intrigued with just about everything on the menu: favs so far are the french onion soup mushrooms, crispy rice with tuna and absolutely LOVED the italian salad – omg the dressing!!!

The skirt steak is topped with a magical chimichurri and the sliced tuna was just delicious.  I have never loved sweet potato anything but their sweet potato gnocchi is quite special which oozes with a yummy sauce.  One night I sat next to a couple who said Haven’s kugel was better than her own “Killer Kugel” and we ended up sharing kugel recipes which only added to the warm and cozy vibe of Haven.  I actually saw a lot of those conversations happen across tables. This place has a community feel that I haven’t felt in a neighborhood restaurant…maybe ever.  I ended up drinking Haven’s sauvignon blanc each time which was priced well and tasted delicious.  My husband is an avid beer drinker and has loved the Talea on tap. The wait staff has been super friendly and I am pretty sure a few know me by name, which is also something I have longed for living on the upper west for over 20 years.
