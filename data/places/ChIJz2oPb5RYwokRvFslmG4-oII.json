I had cut my thumb with a glass and bleeding for a couple of hours. Not being from NY and living out of state I was scared. Not only was I scared but I never had gotten stitches before. The ER doctor had told me orginaly she was just going to glue it shut. However, DR.Wolf didn’t like that idea and decided to give me stitches. Nervous as ever he was called in to come to Beth Israel Mount Sinai. He came in and acted as if he was my friend not my doctor. He examined me and decided I didn’t need to have nail taken off as I also cut through the nail. He left my room in the ER and then came back with some supplies for the stitches. I was super nervous he numbed my thumb and then began the stitches. Throughout the whole time we spoke about college and all types of different topics to keep my mind of the stitches and DR. Wolf just kept telling me you will be fine. He really did try and make me feel at eaze. Four days after the incident and I am holding up I can’t thank him enough for his great bed side manner. I also liked the fact that he also gave me his cell phone number and told me not to hesitate to call if I needed anything or had any questions. I will write another review after I visit him again to have my stitches removed. Overall awesome doctor and explains everything too you."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Doctor Wolf made my bad experience very well.
