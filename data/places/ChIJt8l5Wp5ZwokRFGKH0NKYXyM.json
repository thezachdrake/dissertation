The dark shimmery blue gel color I chose looked purple on my nail which wasn’t my inspo so after two coats they were quick to find me a dark blue top layer.

The nail art design was $35 extra and so worth it!\n\nWe tried 4-5 shades of white and yellow dots for the center but Angela found a gold color which fit the vibe way more. A pale yellow and white was too light of color in contrast to the dramatic dark blue background. they really put in the work and time, and gave me massages before and after. I was expecting to be there for an hour or so but this probably took closer to two hours when i left.
