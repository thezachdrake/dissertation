The instructions on the kiosk are pretty confusing. For $12 a bike + tax you can ride for 24hrs, but you have to bring the bike back & dock it every 30 minutes then wait 2 minutes to get a new code THEN you can take a bike again. 🤔 Huh? Yeah... So one of the employees in a citi bike uniform explained that you pay the flat rate of $12 & that's all you pay for the day if you dock the bike every 30 minutes. If you don't, then you're charged a late fee based on how much longer you kept the bike out. I rented 2 bikes & set the timer on my phone for 20 minutes to make sure that I wouldn't be late. We road around Battery Park, which was very nice. After the 20 minutes, we brought the bikes back, but before we docked them a different citi bike employee asked if this was our first 30 minutes riding. He then explained that the first 30 minutes are free, so there was no need to dock the bikes. We could go ahead & keep riding for another 30 mins. We did so, only to find out that we were charged an $8.71 late fee. 😠 So of course I called citi bike customer service because why should I be charged a late fee for an employee giving me the wrong information? Citi bike could care less what I was told & refused to give me a refund. Oh, & the $202 deposit fee that was charged to my card still hasn't been put back 48hrs later when I was told it would only take 24hrs. I'm completely taken back by citi bike's customer service. Definitely my first & last time renting bikes from them."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I went to New York for the first time & decided to go bike riding around Battery Park.
