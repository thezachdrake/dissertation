Also during our very limited lunch and recess period we have to be silent for the last 2 minutes fine what ever but if one person talks they have to stay after school for an additional 15 minutes, but not only that but the whole entire grade has to stay for 2 minutes and they're kids that get 45 minutes of detention after school (The max) everyday and so it doesn't affect them but they are making the entire grade stay longer and  this is only if 1 person talks this goes on for a long time. We still have to go to the park which is about a 7 minute walk, so we normally would have 20 minutes of play time but with these kids we have no joke about 5 to 7 minutes of time outside.
