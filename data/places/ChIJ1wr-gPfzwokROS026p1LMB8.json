The office staff who I dealt with in setting up the appointment and who greeted me in person on the day of the appointment were nice, professional and efficient. I was seen immediately with barely any wait at all. The X-ray tech and hygienist were both gentle and thorough and Dr Evy was nice and seems thorough and competent. I felt like I was in good, skillful hands throughout. Also, it’s a beautifully designed office. Everything is bright, tidy and well-maintained. I had been long overdue for a checkup and it’s always a little stressful to begin with a new dentist / dental practice. It can be uncomfortable and painful getting dental procedures, especially for those like me who have a low pain-threshold. Dr Evy was sensitive to this and communicated proactively at each stage, responding to my feedback about discomfort immediately with the appropriate measures. It’s such a relief to have gotten all the needed work outlined and to have started immediately on the day of my checkup with half of the planned work. The only tiny negative is that I had to remind the tech that I hadn’t gotten one item (fluoride treatment) done that we had intended to do; but they immediately rectified the situation and got it done before I left. I will be going back soon for the other half of the planned work, and I feel confident that it will go well based on how the first appointment went.
