Also, when healed over I think an explanation of how to use the tiller to change heading and reduce the amount of heel. Charlie's explanation of adjusting the main to help flatten the boat was good, but I think the students would have benefited from the method using the tiller earlier in the sail.\n\nAll in a great time, except for my re-introduction to motion sensitivity.
