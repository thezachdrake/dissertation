So lately I’ve been dealing with anxiety and I figured that it was time to meet someone that could really help me out. I looked in Zocdoc and searched for several psychiatrists in NYC and decided to go with him for his 5 star reviews. Even though it’s extremely expensive ($400 a session) I figured it was necessary so I gave it a shot. During the session we had a good conversation and he made some good observations (nothing really out of this world just a couple of points that made me reflect). However the reason why I’m giving him a two star review is because I believe he didn’t really grasp the issues that I was dealing with. His diagnose lacked  insight and he automatically prescribed me Zoloft ( which is a SSRI). This would “help me” in the long run but it has terrible side effects and I’m not really comfortable taking anything like that. When I asked him through text if there was an alternative treatment he refuses to give me any alternatives and pushed for another session. In other words, if you’re looking just to get medicated and forget about the real issue this is the place to go, but if you want some deep and analytical insight don’t waste your time or money."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’m giving him a 2 star review for several reasons.
