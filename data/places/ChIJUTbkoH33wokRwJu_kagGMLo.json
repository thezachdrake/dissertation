I went to another dollar store on Amsterdam that had tea light candles I wanted for cheaper and with a bigger bottle of Butane at half the price.\n\nI’ll conclude that i used to enjoy this dollar store when it was being lead by a nice female. The male owner has a passive aggressive attitude that ill say is gentle nasty. He doesn’t belong in customer service. Might lose customers and have to downsize the store again to make room for another business to rent space, if they keep operating at this pace. ."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was very disappointed today. 1st: on google, it shows the location being open at 7am but they dont open at 7am. 2nd: I got there at 9am and the owner is standing outside like he is locked out and waiting for someone to come with the key. 3rd: I came back at 9:40 am to get the things on my list.
