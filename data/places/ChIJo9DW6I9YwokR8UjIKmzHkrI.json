There is parking under the building and you have to obviously pay for it or you might get lucky on one of the streets. And it's a little walk to get Inside so put good walking shoes on because you're going to get your steps in here lol there is a new Shark exhibit and it's really cool! But it's a little room that's fast to go through. The gems and minerals part is literally out of this world and more beauty then can ever imagine! The Dino exhibit is amazing to see these huge skeletons of what was long ago! And much much more! There are elevators and stairs you can take. Bathrooms everywhere and food and drinks and gift shops! Everything you do at the end has a gift shop, before you leave the museum that gift shop has everything all the others have, so don't load up on the way and have to carry all that stuff around with you all day! Bring a backpack that helps, and they will search it before entering! As well as walking through a metal detector. They are still requesting you ware a mask and will give you one if forgotten for free. People from all over the world come here every day. That says it all.
