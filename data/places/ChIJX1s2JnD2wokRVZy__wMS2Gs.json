The staff as well recompenses those students who have had perfect attendance and that were in the honor roll for the marking period with a movie night or a different activity for our accomplishments. Mott Hall High School has also offered me tutoring which is after school. I've had the opportunity to study for my exams and regents with my teachers, which include classes such as Math, Science, Social studies and English. Also Mott Hall provides students of the 11th and 12th grade to experience college by giving us the option to attend college courses.Overall, Mott Hall High School has been an amazing school with good opportunities that would prepare us for the future."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am junior at Mott Hall High School, and I believe that the school has made great improvements.
