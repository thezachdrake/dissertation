At first I was feeling a bit skeptical about it because the appointments we're always way too far to schedule especially when you're in desperate need of treatment. I gave it a shot anyway. It's a good thing I did. The dentist and his staff are very professional and I feel comfortable here. Dr. Marcus is an amazing Dental professional who knows his stuff.

Now it's always up to a patient weather a doctor should proceed with whatever needs to be done. I have no objections, I've never had any objections and I don't think I would have any objections as far as to what they do or what decisions they make regarding my treatment. As I mentioned in the beginning I have a phobia of the dentist so it takes a lot for me to get to really trust a dental professional. I needed extractions and dr. Marcus referred me to one of the best oral surgeons I have ever been to. They are very caring, very professional and they in fact know what they are doing as well! As soon as I was called in I sat in the chair and they injected me with an IV and before you know it I was in the recovery room in no pain whatsoever. I could go on and on and on about this place but I won't. I'll let you see for yourself. I am a medical professional myself and I know how stressful it can be dealing with multiple practices in one office. You will probably walk into this place and think to yourself oh my goodness how do they do it or oh my goodness what am I getting myself into but believe me it will be worth it in the long run.
