contribution could start with one dollar a month ($1). I agreed to contribute with one dollar per month and I know its not much but at least im helping. Two weeks later I get a letter in the mail saying that I had agreed to give the nature conservancy $10 every month. To some of you it may not sound like much but to me its a little too much, so I called the nature conservancy to tell them that I had agreed to $1 not $10. The Person on the phone told me \"well we can't do anything with $1 a month\".  If I was the only person contributing I get it $1 its not enough but you have thousands of people contributing. After spending 20 minutes on the phone with one of their representatives I was finally able to convince her that I wanted to cancel my subscription. She kept asking me \"are you sure you don't want to contribute anymore?\" during those 20 minutes she must have asked me that question at least 15 times. Finally she tells me that my subscription had been cancelled. When I get my bank statement I see that there is a transaction that  I didn't approved of, yup my subscription had not been cancelled so I had to call again and spend less than 5 minutes talking to a nice lady who told me that my subscription was going to be cancelled and I will get a letter notifying me and sure enough a week later I got a letter to confirm that my subscription was cancelled. My issue now is that I get at least 3 letters every week in the mail asking me to join the nature conservancy again. How are you protecting the nature when you are using so much paper to send letters to people? I get 3 letters every week that is 12 letter per month that 144 letters every year and thats only to one person. STOP sending letters, you are not protecting the nature you are part of the problem!!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I decided to become a member to help a little because I do care about our environment however, when I signed up the girl told me that my contribution could start with one dollar a month ($1).
