About a year ago, the store underwent a gradual--but extensive--makeover which has made the shopping experience more pleasant, even though product selection has remained much the same. BUT...\n\n...my biggest concern with the store--and the main reason shoppers should be wary of shopping here--is that the management *routinely* advertises false prices for goods or does not label prices at all. It is extremely common to see the price advertised as one thing (even with a recent price label, such as for sale items) and then to see the prices $1-2 higher for that item at checkout. Recent examples just from my last shopping trip (see attached photos): a jar of tomato sauce (advertised price: $6.99; actual price: $7.99), avocados (advertised price: $0.99 each; actual price: $2 each), chia seeds (advertised price: $7.99; actual price: $9.29). Importantly, these discrepancies have nothing to do with the shopper's club discount, which everyone seems to get regardless of having signed up. Everyone has noticed increases in grocery prices over the last few years as a result of ongoing inflation. But the situation at Food Universe is not about inflation. This is about mis-advertising prices in a highly unethical way that possibly violates NYC consumer protection laws as well. Twice, I have approached staff about these discrepancies, and have gotten just a shrug.\n\nIf you are interested in a better shopping experience in the broader Hamilton Heights area, I would recommend the Super Food Town at 161st Street, which is bigger, better, and cheaper.
