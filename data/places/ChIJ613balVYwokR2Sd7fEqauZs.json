We arrived back at 4:30pm, and our room still wasn't ready.  They offered to put us in 2 rooms, instead of the single room we'd booked for a family of 4, and stated they were \"connected\".  When we got to the rooms, they were connected b/c they shared a wall, but weren't adjoining and each was a very small room with a double bed, whereas we were supposed to have 2 queen beds and a couch in our room, which we'd planned to have our youngest child sleep on.  I went back down to the desk to let them know this wouldn't work as my kids weren't old enough to stay in a room alone, and the manager heard me at the front desk and came out and told them to upgrade us to the Chatwal Suite!  It was 2 adjoining rooms with a balcony! The room far exceeded our expectations and made for a magical experience for my kids first trip to NYC!!  It was the best trip we could have ever hoped for!  We were there to celebrate my late father's birthday and we had such a wonderful experience at the hotel that it overshadowed any sadness of the day!  The breakfast at the Lamb's Room was delicious!  Oh, and the hotel smells absolutely divine, I am not the kind of person that would normally indulge buying a $100 candle, but it was worth every cent...I haven't even lit it yet, I just smell the box and that is heaven enough!!
