From our first meeting in October 2021 until the end of the party, we had a wonderful experience working with Peter, Josh, and their team. Prior to our initial meeting we asked a fairly long list of questions, and got a pretty good sense of just how detail oriented and attentive they are to the wants and needs of the couple and their guests. They not only answered all of our questions, no matter how repetitive or incredibly specific, but they recalled all of this information in subsequent emails, meetings, and phone calls.\n\nFast forward a few months and we had the opportunity to walk through a tasting menu with Peter, Josh, and their chef. We collaborated on dishes and cocktails, and they were very open and willing to adjust their menu to suit our specific dietary needs, even helping to craft a vegetarian dish which was not on their menu. The variety of choices offered us the ability to satisfy a number of different palates on the day. We feel like we had an honest preview of the food that was to be served on the day of our wedding (and it was wonderful).\n\nGoing over and selecting rentals with Peter was truly a fun and thoughtful experience. While going over these many details can seem daunting or even overwhelming, Peter made us feel at ease and offered suggestions to help guide us through the process. Once again, his familiarity with our venue helped us make choices to complement the space and tie our theme together. Collaborating via phone calls and zoom, we discussed seating charts and an overall sense of what was going to happen on the day which went off without any noticeable hitches.\n\nOn the day itself Peter and his team, led by Maria (our event manager), put our collective plan in motion and provided all of our guests with a truly memorable experience. The food was as good, if not better, than the preview we had at our tasting (and our guests are still talking about it). They were able to make adjustments on the fly when seats were moved or when a guest suddenly needed an alternative meal. Peter was on site for the entire event, even helping to bring out dishes to ensure everyone at the table was served on time. This attention to detail, the ease with which we were able to communicate with Peter and his team, and the overall experience made for an incredible evening. We would very highly recommend KG Fare to anyone looking for a thoughtful and intimately planned affair with all the bells and whistles."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We are so thankful that we chose KG Fare to help cater our wedding this July.
