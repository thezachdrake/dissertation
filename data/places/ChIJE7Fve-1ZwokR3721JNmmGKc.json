I had just bought my truck and put it on the road literally 4 days prior to going there.  It was in mint condition! I left it there in the morning and picked it up about 5pm. While walking around to the driver side I saw a million deep scratches covering approximately a 7\"x 5\" area between the driver side back door n quarter panel. The workers refused to give me the required form to fill out for an incident. The police came and said they're supposed to have the form on hand but none of us could make them give it to us. I'm pretty sure this is a standard practice there. The fake unprofessional manager, Juan Carlos told me he was busy and couldn't come to the site and I'd have to wait 2 days so he could verify on camera what had happened. He never called me back! I chased him down for over a month with no help from even the main office that claims you should call them if there's a problem.  Finally he responds and tells me the camera was broken that day and I should go all the way to NYC so he could see it himself and then, as if he were a body shop employee, tells me it's not a big deal and that I should get a quote from a body work company. I did that and he NEVER responded to my emails or calls again. After going through consumer affairs he refuses to cover the damages because he CLAIMS I can't prove that it happened in his garage and that I didn't walk around my car when I left it there and that I don't have a signed form from the employees there to say it happened there.
