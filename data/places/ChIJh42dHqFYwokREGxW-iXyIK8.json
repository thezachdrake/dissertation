My husband went in for an infusion. Prior to the appointment he specifically requested to be seen by Dr. Naymagon not a PA and was assured that the doctor will see him. Drove 3 hours to this appointment. During the entire visit we were given excuses as to why the doctor is not coming in to the exam room:  is either busy, on video calls with other patients, seeing other patients,  in a meeting, etc. When the infusion was done and IV removed, 15 min later a PA walked in. Had zero knowledge of what was going on, didn’t answer a single question we had, told us she’ll talk to the doctor and will get back to us. My husband’s blood pressure was very high (first time in his life), was retaken 5 times and each time numbers were completely different. I asked for them to try with a different BP machine, they ignored me. They did nothing about the high BP readings. Then the PA told us to make an appointment at the front to return in 4 weeks for an injection. Now here’s where the best part of the visit occurred as if it wasn’t going bad enough. The front desk girl ‘Nelly Duditch’ was very nasty and refused to make an appointment for us. Another woman ‘Sabrina’ came up and said they need to contact insurance to get authorization for the injection first. So we asked for a tentative appointment time since we’re 3 hours away and can only come to NY on specific days/times. She lied saying no one is at the front to make the appointment eventhough 2 secretaries sat at the front.  The whole back and forth took over 20 minutes and they kept saying they need permission from a doctor to make a TENTATIVE Apt eventhough we tried to explain the doctor never came to see us and the PA told us to make the appointment. Finally Dr. N all of a sudden became available IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY with other patients within inches from us, asking us how my husband is reacting to the infusions (SOMETHING HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE EXAM ROOM where we were for 1.5 hours!!!). He then told the staff to make an appointment for us! Front continued to behave as if they’re doing us a favor with zero apologies!
