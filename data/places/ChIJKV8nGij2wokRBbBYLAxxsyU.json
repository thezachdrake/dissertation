Way more than I thought was possible for the price. It was remodeled and very spacious&modern looking. (Note: only a part of the hotel is remodeled yet) The fridge was super; the microwave worked well although we only used it once. No problems with the shower/hot water; we filled the bath multiple nights , the pressure and temperature were good. Tv was very nice, we spend quite a lot time inside the room and it was big enough for my daughter to practice dance moves and storage her costumes. The staff was Super Friendly, they showed interest in my daughter's ballet progress during her competition in the theater across the street. They would ask her how it went each day and were really happy and supportive. They really made us feel welcome and at home. I ordered some packages before and during my stay and they were very helpful and remembered my name after 1 day. Tea, coffee, bananas and 3 types of cookies/snacks were provided each day. The snack machine was working well. Enough choices to eat in this street/area (most do close before 11pm so 1night we ate the chips from the machine as a very late 'diner') the staff provided plenty of water bottles /extra shampoo/towels and the cleaning ladies were very nice; they were flexible in cleaning hours which was helpful since we were resting a lot in our room between rehearsals/dancing etc. The dust on our bedstands is the only 'negative' thing i can mention. The metro station in 96street is perfect! They have a 24/7 info boot. The hotel staff arranged a very luxury taxi for our ride back to the airport . A bit more $$ compare to the yellow cab we took from JFK but i didn't mind due of the friendly staff at the hotel and the very nice car; it was a great last ride. I would definitely rebook again!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Went here mid June for 8 nights, i was Very Pleased with our room!
