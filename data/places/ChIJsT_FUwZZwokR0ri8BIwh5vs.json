And then he gave me the most painless shot to the jaw I've ever had, and started the root canal 15 minutes later. I did not feel ANY pain, even though I anticipated I would.  He stopped mid procedure and said I am not finishing this job, because the whole tooth is crack and needs to be pulled.  The charged me less than 1/3 of their initial predicted cost.
