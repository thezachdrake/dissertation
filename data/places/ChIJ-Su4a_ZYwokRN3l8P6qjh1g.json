I never realised just how big it was. I would recommend the company. Had a lovely time cycling round, there is a road way you can follow around the whole park. There are some hills involved. Very quick and efficient service. Lady was very friendly and offered good advice. I was after an electric scooter but they did have these at this location.\nHappy cycling!"},"publishTime":"2022-03-16T13:12:12Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.77009398029149,"longitude":-73.97993836970849},"low":{"latitude":40.7673960197085,"longitude":-73.9826363302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":8,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":20,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":8,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":20,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":8,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":20,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":8,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":20,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":8,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":20,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":8,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":20,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":8,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":20,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Saturday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","Sunday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"Central Park W, New York"}
