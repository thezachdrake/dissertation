I started getting leads, but they were going to the email address of my paypal account instead of to the email address I put on my account with them.  I contacted support and said I was happy with the leads, but asked if could they redirect them to my other email address that I use for bookings, since that is not a setting I could change in my account profile. I expected this to be a simple request. I received an email from Allen Boykins in support that said the default is to send leads to the paypal address and that if I was unhappy with the leads, they could refund me and cancel the service.  I sent a response that I was very happy with the leads, I just wanted to know if they could change the email address.  I  got no response and stopped seeing any leads.  After a week, I responded again to Allen's email and asked again if there was any way they could update my account, and to please turn the leads back on as I had stopped receiving them.  I also said that if they really couldn't update my email address, I would deal with them going to the wrong address, just please turn the leads back on.  I got a terse reply from Allen that my account was being cancelled and I'd be refunded; no other explanation given; no response to my concerns was made.  I was completely shocked.  This was so abrupt and opposite of what I expected that I thought there must be some kind of miscommunication due to a language barrier.  My very clear requests were going unanswered and my account was closed against my wishes.  I responded immediately that this was not the action I was seeking, that I wanted to continue getting leads and I asked Allen if he understood English and if there was a supervisor I could speak with.  I got back a one sentence email from Allen saying, \"We are so done.\".   Who says this to a customer? I received notice from paypal that my subscription was cancelled and my money was refunded, but this is far from a satisfactory result.  I cannot condone the rude behavior of their representative.  The number of leads was decent, but their user interface is very disorganized and just as unfriendly to the user as their customer support person.  I don't recommend anyone do business with them.\n\nUpdate:  Apparently he decided his one sentence was not enough.  I just got this as well: \"Yes, I understand English. Your subscription has been cancelled. You have a mouth on you that won't stop! Sincerely, Allen B.\"\nAll I asked for was a simple email change. I spent a week getting ignored and then had my account cancelled for no reason, and received this abuse on top of it.  I hope I just got the 1 jerk in the bunch and other customers aren't dealing with this."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I subscribed as wedding officiant to their leads service to get connected with couples in my area that want to book an officiant.
