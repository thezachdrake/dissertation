Minervini is very knowledgeable, and at times, Minervini posted sound stocks and excellent trades, and I would recommend his books. However, it seemed to me that he also used his knowledge and skill to exploit the hope and greed of his clients.\n\nFirst, I think his service is overpriced at $6000 a year, and his Master Trader Program is overpriced at $5000. Also, I think Minervini is a terrible teacher. In the question-and-answer session, Minervini would commonly get irritated at his client’s questions and criticize their questions. I think that you can find better services and programs at a lower cost with more effective teachers.\n\nSecond, Minervini focuses on volatility contraction in stocks because when the stock moves to either the upside or downside, it can be explosive especially if the stock is thinly traded. However, the stock can also be manipulated especially if the stock has weak fundamentals. Each week, Minervini would post the stocks he was watching at the market open, so you did not have time to research them, and the stocks would commonly change from week to week. Thus, it would be a challenge to get a strong understanding of the stock’s fundamentals.\n\nDuring market hours, Minervini would put out a “breakout alert” or “buy now” alerts on the stocks he was watching as the stocks were breaking out. At times, the breakout was a legitimate market induced breakout because the stock was heavily traded. However, commonly the stock was thinly traded with weak fundamentals, and the stock would surge in value, and then come crashing down. At times, I saw the service would put out a breakout or buy now alert on a stock. I looked at the stock on Market Smith, and it was not breaking out, but moments later, it broke out. It could have been a lag in my internet, but it happened several times, so it seemed as if Minervini or the service was creating the breakout, pumping it to their clients, and then selling into the manipulated demand. Also, Minervini would add stocks to the watch list during the trading session. At times, just after adding the stock, the stock would breakout and at times, eventually crash down. Minervini even admitted to “popping” stocks at times because his account size was so large, so he has to make large purchases.\n\nMinervini said one of his tactics was to enter the trade with large size, sell a portion into strength, and then free roll the rest, which is a sound strategy, if the stock is breakout on fundamental reasons and not manipulation. Thus, it seemed his service was alerting their clients to a combination of both legitimate and manipulated stock breakouts.\n\nMinervini also talked a lot about the compounding effect of small profits turned over frequently enough to accomplish your goal. This is a sound strategy, but the hard part is consistently doing it. Unless, let say you hypothetically pumped up a thinly traded stocks with weak fundamentals to your clients after you purchased large amount of the stock to create a breakout.  Then, you sold your shares after your clients drove up the price. If you do that frequently enough, you might be able to win something like the US Investment Championship.\n\nI lost a lot of respect for IBD because they give this guy a lot of airtime."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was a member of Minervini Private Access for several years and attended his Master Trader Program.
