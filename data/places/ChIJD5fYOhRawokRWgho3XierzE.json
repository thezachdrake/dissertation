The place had a bare-bones setup with seating that's hard to come by, hinting at an almost exclusive experience for those who stumble upon it.\n\nIt struck me odd that a restaurant in such a busy slice of the city would be so quiet at 4:15 p.m., but the peace was welcome. One person was holding down the fort, but his demeanor was warm and professional, ensuring my meal was on the table without delay.\n\nDiving into the menu, the choice was simple—the day's special caught my attention. The Fried Flounder with Fresh Fries came out piping hot and in abundance. The flounder was fried to a satisfying crispness, hiding the tender fish within, while the fries maintained their crisp even as they cooled—a pleasing duo by any measure.\n\nHowever, the fried calamari I added on the side didn't quite hit the mark. It was missing the expected burst of taste, which contrasted with the otherwise flavorful meal.\n\nI washed it all down with a diet coke—the only option since the place doesn't serve alcohol, which suited me just fine. The presentation was no-frills, with the meal served in simple takeaway containers accompanied by disposable utensils. This was ideal for me, especially needing a quick bite after a trip to Staten Island and heading home.\n\nSo, if you're around the Ferry Terminal and need a fast, delicious seafood dish, this spot could be worth the stop. Although the calamari was a bit of a letdown, the rest of the meal made up for it, and the overall experience was enjoyable. I give it four stars for the food and the hassle-free dining experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Title: Terrace Fish & Chips: A Pleasant Surprise in Lower Manhattan\n\nReview:\n\nDinner at Terrace Fish & Chips on Pearl Street was a refreshing change from the usual bustling eateries of New York.
