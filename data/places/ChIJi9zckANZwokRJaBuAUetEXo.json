There is no phone communication allowed, only letters, and you're lucky to receive two before the two weeks are up.\n\nOur close knit family traveled often and was accustomed to communications via phone, text and emails. So my child had severe separation anxiety once he got to the camp. He had camp mates that, when left unsupervised, weren't very kind and initiated physical altercations. He wrote home begging us to come get him while also writing that he had tried to be brave and not cry but he really missed us and wanted to come home. My husband drove up the same day we received that letter and my son broke down in tears when they brought him out to us. And because he did not complete the entire two weeks he was disqualified from the program altogether.\n\nThe Fresh Air Fund has a one-style-fits-all structure for its program but it's  not ideal for anxious children. To know at a designated time they can check in with a parent makes a significant impact on a child with separation anxiety. It can give them the emotional support they need to complete the two-week requirement and feel successful that they completed such a necessary step in the program.\n\nThankfully I found a program with a similar sleep-away requirement that allowed any interested campers 15 minute nightly video chats or phone calls and it made a huge difference for my family. My son relished in showing me his camp, his campmates, and sharing the day's activities. I saw how happy he was and was glad he allowed me to enroll him in another program because he was very mistrustful of camps after his Fresh Air Fund experience.\n\nThis is not to say The Fresh Air Fund won't work for your extroverted and outgoing child, but parents should know how this may affect children who need extra support."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I feel this program really is geared for the underprivileged child unexposed to travel and opportunities.
