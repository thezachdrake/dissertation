I have no accent, only speak English, am a third generation brown person, and I was told by the woman making the appointment she couldn’t understand my accent. I assumed she was just a racist outlier, but my treatment at NYU was pretty consistent to that first phone call. Before my appointment with Dr. Keefe, I was told to call a number the first day of my period, to come in for a blood test. I called the number every ten minutes for over an hour and a half. I got a loop message saying they weren’t open until 7am… I was calling between 8:15 and 10am. When I went to my blood drawing appointment, they were confused why I was there, and when I checked out I was lectured about affordability. I was told how expensive my procedures would be and how they aren’t for everyone. I was the only non white person in the waiting room and the only one receiving this unsolicited advice. After I met with Dr. Keefe, I was told by his coordinator, Ivette, I would have to wait two more cycles to start egg retrieval because there’s a six week waiting list for some class that I had to take before I could start the process. When I told her this is unacceptable and I feel discriminated against, because two of my friends are patients and didn’t have to wait FIVE cycles before getting egg retrieval. She told me I must not have been asking the right questions - no, I was either speaking to someone incompetent or they weren’t listening to what I was saying, because they were too focused on my skin color or my last name to care. My two white friends, got to do egg retrieval between two and six weeks, but the brown person has to wait five months? I honestly feel unsafe leaving my eggs, with their non white DNA, in the hands of a hospital that has a higher than average mortality rate of ethnic minorities dying in child birth. NYU refused to release my blood test results to their portal - what do I have to say or do to make them treat me half as decent as they treated my white friends."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I waited over two months for an appointment for egg retrieval, while my two white friends were seen within two weeks of calling.
