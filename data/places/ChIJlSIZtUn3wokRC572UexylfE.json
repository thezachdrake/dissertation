I put my daughter in for about 2 months and I was super excited because this was her first daycare and I toured the place and thought the place was so cute for her. They took her right away which I loved because I needed a daycare immediately. I didn’t have any issues until one day while picking her up, I saw her ear was extremely red and  I saw a baby probably about 6 to 7 months old crying on the floor and nobody was watching her and their son who is 4 years old started to put his finger in her mouth while she was crying then he continued to lick his finger and put it back into her mouth then he tried to put his toe in her mouth which I was in shock because if they don’t notice their son doing such a crazy action they probably aren’t watching my daughter that well, I did let the Father know about the situation in messages and he thanked me but I’m sure he didn’t let the child’s mother know about the incident either.Another incident that recently happened was a child scratching my daughter on her face, a deep scratch and the man who works at the place explained my daughter was playing with blocks with another child and my child took the block and the other child went up to her and scratched my daughter on her face, this could’ve all been avoided if the children were being closely watched. I was notified about the incident AFTER  while picking her up and not right away because one of the workers felt “ it wasn’t important enough to tell right away” because it was just a scratch but personally if my child is screaming because she got a scratch on her face I would want to know right away! Soon after I took my daughter out and it was obvious that they did not have a close relationship with her and they were so easy to say bye to her when I removed her. It made me feel they saw her as a dollar sign. Honestly I feel there’s too many kids in the daycare and it probably isn’t easy for them to handle all of them. There’s 4 year olds mixed with 5 month old babies. It sad to say such bad things about a daycare that seems so nice but I feel all parents should be aware of what’s happening. They do have their good moments, where they cook for the children and they will post your child here and there playing with other kids but it sucks to know that your child could be getting scratched or bothered by someone who is older than them. I spoke to a few family and friends about the situation and they all felt it was important to be honest and let other parents know for the safety and concerns for love ones."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"decent daycare.
