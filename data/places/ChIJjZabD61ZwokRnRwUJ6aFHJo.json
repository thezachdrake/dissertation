The hotel is in close proximity to Bryant Park, Central Park, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square & Rockefeller Center as well as various coffee shops and eateries. There is a small market on the main floor but not a lot of options. Same goes for the cafe inside the hotel. That’s not a big deal due to having so many options nearby. My only complaint is the noise level. You can hear conversations in the hallway very loudly. There was some outside traffic noise as well. The hotel room doors are also very loud and don’t close softly.  Instead they slam shut which made it difficult to get a good nights sleep.
