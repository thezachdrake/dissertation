I finally had a child in August 1980. What a wonderful man he is!  He's kind, caring and very gentle. Since I was pregnant I also had to see Dr. Cherry and Dr. Moss. Every doctor in this practice was awesome!  I had a big problem becoming and then staying pregnant. Until finally unknown to me I was three months pregnant. My regular M.D. told me to see my Gynecologist. One look and he knew I was pregnant. A test was done in the office that confirmed that information. But a send away test also confirmed the information. I already had two negative pregnancy tests done before I was past the three month mark. Of course I was followed very carefully during my pregnancy. All went well until my eighth  month when I started bleeding. I went to the hospital and they wound up keeping me overnight. Or I thought it was just overnight. I gave birth to a beautiful 4lb. 7oz. Baby girl. She was perfect. They sent her up to the PICU which she stayed in for seventeen days. I was in the hospital for three days back in the eighties. Dr. Jaffin was on top of my health!  He wanted my husband and I to know how happy he was for us. We tried to have another child but that never happened. We have moved to Florida where we brought up our daughter. She is now a married mother of two beautiful children. I was just twenty years old when I first went to Dr. Jaffin. Most likely he does not remember me. But I will never ever forget him and his partners!  Thank you Dr. Jaffin and thank you Dr Cherry for giving me a copy of your first book!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was a patient of Dr.Herbert Jaffin starting in1965.
