Upon visiting her vast website the viewer will be lifted into a world of compelling and diverse imagery, culminating in her touching tribute to her Native American lineage where she tells the stories of her ancestor's migration and her Cherokee family's personal story of slavery and ultimately to freedom in her breathtaking images that recall not only her family's journey from slavery to free people, she also incorporates mythology and Jungian archetypes and Native symbolism where she visually integrates the dream world and the waking life, and the after life commonly featured in Native American Art. Camille is a critically acclaimed internationally recognized artist with numerous awards and museum exhibitions. She has a huge following on LinkedIn and Instagram and can be found across all social media platforms. She currently lives and works in New York. Her popular website, which she uses as a free virtual exhibition of work in progress is available for everyone around the globe and gets up to 200 international visitors globally every week. Please note I will be in New Jersey from November-June undergoing spinal reconstructive surgery and spinal rehab, intensive physical therapy for a year!

I won't be taking any new client's, I'm only exhibiting with my wonderful gallery in Rome who because they are the kindest, gentlest most dedicated souls I've ever met in my life and without Claudio Giunelli, the director my career would not be possible as he handles all the printing, framing, installation, and shipping of my work all around the world! There are no words to express the depths of my gratitude for the beautiful man, expert curator and art's champion! There's no one in the art world who doesn't know and adore Claudio as I do."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Welcome to Native Light Photography where owner Camille Ross takes the viewer on a tour of the American Southwest to Mexico then on to Colombia in her captivating documentary work of the Tarahumara Indians, then onto the famous neighborhood just outside of the walled city of Cartagena, Colombia that Marquez wrote so often about.
