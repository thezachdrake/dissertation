From the gentlemen that greeted you when you first arrived or when you said goodbye, to the front desk, to the butlers, to the waitstaff in the restaurant and bar, all of them were some of the most professional and friendly people you will ever meet.

The doorman was pretty cold and not very friendly and welcoming. No one to help open the door or greet arrivals. The front desk agent gave us the card explaining the destination charge and benefits per night but then at checkout, they said that the corporate rate waived the destination charge.

Person at check-out was extremely unwilling to fix this issue until I pressed her in which case she finally gave extra credit to cover the breakfast charges of both rooms on the one folio.
