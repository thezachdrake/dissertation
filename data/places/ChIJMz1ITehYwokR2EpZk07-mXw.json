I had 2 days before vacation and all I needed was a simple single-color process and a trim. I also saw online that they offered organic color which I was highly interested in, I got an appt quickly and thought this is perfect… However, I was surely mistaken.\n\nDuring my FIRST visit, everything seemed to be going fine. Together George and I chose a medium brown color as I have Jet black hair and agreed that it is typically hard to lighten dark hair so it would be fine. I clearly expressed that I was going for a dark brown and did not want my hair to be too light. He mentioned something about the color spectrum/how black hair takes color and ensured me it wouldn’t be light or red. All was well until he started to blow dry my hair and I took a closer look. Right there and then I told him it looked reddish and he assured me that it wasn’t and that it looked good. As soon as I stepped out into the sun, it was clear, my hair was in fact an auburn color. Being that I had other appts, I continued my day.\n\nSo the next morning, I called first thing and spoke to George who said he can get me in at any time and correct it in 15-20mins. Perfect again? NO. I go in a SECOND time and tell him to please darken/even out the color (my roots were a reddish brown and an uneven brown throughout the length). He mixes it up (not even sure if he even used organic color), places the color only on my roots, I sit for a few minutes and get my hair washed HOWEVER the roots are STILL obviously a different color than the rest of my hair. At this point, I’m well over 45mins into my 1hr lunch break, hungry and flustered – I obliged and asked him to dye my hair (for the THIRD time) black again. He then places the color only on my roots and not my whole head (never corrected the overall color which I originally paid for).\n\nBefore leaving I stopped by the owner, who at the time was with a client. Not wanting to pull her away I simply told her I wanted to speak to her about the service I received and that I could wait a little to talk quickly or she could call/email me later. However, she just scowled at me and told me “You need to talk to him about that” and turned her back.\n\nWhen I spoke to George to voice my concerns re: the quality of service I received he immediately insinuated that I was trying to receive free services. First of all, let’s be clear that I usually go to the Ouidad Salon and easily pay $500+ for cut, color, and tip. I have NO problem paying for QUALITY services however I felt that I should have been discounted and/or at least met with a compromise for the time and inconvenience caused because of poor service. Honestly, I would have been more than happy to compromise however all I was met with was attitude and a lecture about “how things work”/accusations of trying to get over on him.\n\nOverall, I’m shocked to say that I’ve never been so happy to see my jet-black hair again. I’m also appalled as I am a very polite/courteous person /rarely complain and I was met with such disgust and poor customer service when trying to express the stress/inconvenience my experience caused.  Being that BOTH the stylist and manager failed to hear me out and showed complete disrespect to not only my time but also the health of my hair – that alone should warrant caution to all future customers. Regardless of your hair type, age, or ethnicity I would never recommend this salon to anyone."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I found this salon online as I was in search of a highly reviewed salon local to my place of work.
