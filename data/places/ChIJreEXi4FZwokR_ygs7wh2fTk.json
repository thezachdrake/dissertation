Our top recommendation is the Chicken Paitan – don't be alarmed by the raw egg on top; it adds a delicious touch without an overly eggy flavor. For an extra kick, try adding roasted tomatoes; it's a worthwhile investment that elevates the ramen's taste. Having visited a couple of times, we consistently opt for the same dishes. We also suggest starting with the Japanese fried chicken,  the Wagyu pastrami buns (great twist if you're not big on pork) and pairing it with the refreshing lemonade. Surprisingly, we managed to secure a table without a reservation and experienced prompt service. While we happily give it 5 stars for the food and service, we'd rate the atmosphere 4 stars due to its slightly crowded feel – still a fantastic spot to enjoy with friends. Just reminiscing about it makes me crave another visit!
