I think I was the only proper adult in the room apart from the instructor, but that was fine. The other three students were high school students.

We did 10 laps as a warm-up; the area is roughly the size of a basketball court if I had to give you a mental model of the size of the space. After the jog we did a brief period of stretching then went into the Ninja training.\n\nWithin 1.5 hour, I was pretty able to sample most of the exercises; at least the ones I was capable of doing.  There wasn't any rigid structure and programming, and I got to hop in and out of the different obstacle courses. A lot of the exercises require a decent amount of upper body strength. If you aren't used to swing and hanging off things, then your grip strength will definitely be challenged. They also have a balanced based obstacle course if that is more your forte. They rotate parts of the obstacle course on the weekly basis, so there are always new challenges to try.\n\nThe instructor, Sebastian, was wonderful and very encouraging. My only regret is that I wish they had things like this when I was younger. I had so much fun, and I'm happy something like exist. They also had so much fun.\n\nThere is another location in Gowanus called Brooklyn Ninja Academy. Which might be more convenient for any Brooklynites. This one is a bit tough to get to if you're taking the train because it's all the way on 12 Avenue and 55th street, but the closest train is located on 59th and 8th Avenue.\n\nSome recommendations that, I felt, could have the experience even better:\n\nProvide locker rooms to change. The only place to change in privacy is the one unisex bathroom, which was clean, by the way.\n\nA vending machine with drinks or water cooler would be great since this is a gym.\n\nA courtesy email reminder sent out 24–72 hours before class is always a nice touch.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend trying this out.
