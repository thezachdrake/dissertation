We were here back in 2018 for the performance of Summer: The Donna Summer Musical. About 45 minutes prior to the start of the show, the doors were opened, and the staff were outside directing patrons into entry lines, depending on the location of their seats. The staff will seat those on the mezzanine level first. However, due to the bitter cold winds, once those in the mezzanine went inside, the staff would then let those in the orchestra level inside to the mezzanine level to use the bathroom, stop at the bar or buy souvenirs, and wait until the inside theater doors were opened. Once inside, we were greeted by the staff, who scanned both of our tickets and then directed us to our seats. Several ushers inside were making sure that everyone got to their seats without issue. Since the stage is so high in the first 4 rows, these will have some view obstructions. It’s suggested to get seats beyond that, as we were in orchestra row K. The acoustics were perfect, especially to hear the live music from a classic 26-player orchestration and be able to see the stage without any obstructions. However, some seats were tight if you're tall and don’t leave room for each other. The performance was incredibly lively, and the atmosphere had just the right touch of spooky elements, adding to the overall charm of the show, which we can recommend."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Named in honor of America's foremost husband-wife acting couple, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, my partner and I arrived at the Lunt Fontanne Theatre last night to see Sweeney Todd during Broadway week.
