But up to a certain extent, the coaches are no longer helpful. I'm a mainly defensive player, and learning how to hit was incredibly difficult because of the coach's non-constructive criticism. With this, I would say that the way hot is advertised is somewhat deceptional. Traci (being the owner of hot) is incredibly helpful, but rarely coaches consistently due to the variety of different classes she teaches. Traci helps players become self-sufficient athletes, while most other coaches at hot tend to produce volleyball players that can't work with their team well enough to play the team sport efficiently.  I also find that alot of the coaches are quite impatient for teachers working with adolescents.  Volleyball is an extremely technical game, and the process of learning it and improving at it requires many mistakes and misinterpretations, and coaches need to be more support of that at hot. Most of the time, coaches notice a mistake in a player's form or technique and tell them the mistake. I've very rarely seen coaches tell players how to improve their form, rather just tell them what to do for the bare minimum.  If your player is someone that wants to be someone that \"knows how to play volleyball\" or an \"average volleyball player\" then this is perfect for your player. If your player wants to harness their talents and become an \"exceptional volleyball player\", then i would personally say that paying upwards of 500$ for most classes is not worth it."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"As a current high school player here, I've learned some valuable things.
