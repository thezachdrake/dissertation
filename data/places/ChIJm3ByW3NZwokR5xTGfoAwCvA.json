The gates were locked at 6 am and the multiple times I was circling. When it came close to my time and I still couldn’t find street parking, I was going to use my 615 reserved spot, issue was at 615 the gates were still down and locked. At 625 they were finally up and the worker was extremely rude before I even started talking and I was the first car in im told I need to wait, that he doesn’t need this in the morning etc etc and that he came from queens. I live and commuted from queens also, that’s not an excuse. If the garage is suppose to be open at 6 am you need to be there before your start time. I get stuff happens but this was almost 30 minutes after your suppose to be open and you are giving me extreme attitude when I didn’t even get nasty. I get at times too there are wait times, it’s Manhattan but don’t especially give me the line “I need to get my work pants on” etc etc and you are going extremely slow. Your dealing with people , and your extremely extremely late, that is your fault not mine. All my jobs I’ve had you can’t be late that’s why you leave early and give cushion time. It’s common sense it’s not raining it’s not snowing.
