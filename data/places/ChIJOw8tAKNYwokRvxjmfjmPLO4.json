I enjoy every minute I work with Nancy!  From the moment she walks in the door, she determines what needs to be done and always makes sure that the client is comfortable with her recommendations.  If not, she works around her client's ideas, whether or not she totally agrees with them.  This makes it so comfortable working with Nancy because she takes the time to understand her client and figure out how to make the client happy with the end result.  I've worked with another expert in de-cluttering, but there is simply no comparison between my experience with the first one and Nancy.  Nancy takes joy in seeing her client's happiness in the work that she has done with you.
