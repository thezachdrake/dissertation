My palate isn't sophisticated enough to really get into whether specific food is worthy of that type of accolade (besides this, I've been to a restaurant in San Juan that had a Michelin rating  - 1919 in Condado - and I remember more about the presentation of the dishes and the black horse lamp/statute right outside than the taste of the food) but I can say that it's the best of the options in Urban Space, and there's some legit competition here.\n\nThis was initially a recommendation by one of my chums a few months ago. I've been coming to Urban Space since it opened last summer and have regularly frequented the Playa Bowls (way less depressing than the one down the street at One New York Plaza), the Puerto Rican place and the prior pizza establishment. All perfectly fine, depending on your mood, but Katsu didn't catch my eye for whatever reason. It's very tasty, and not like the \"normal\" curry you expect with Indian food (which was my mistaken impression) - it's a sweeter curry and for me at least far preferable. I don't hate Indian food, but I need to be in the mood for it, which only happens every six months or so. This type of curry? I could eat on at least a weekly basis, and sometimes I have. There's enough of the curry provided that it should be able to soak up not only the slices of chicken, but the scoop of accompanying rice as well (I can do without the thin strands of radishes or whatever is also included). The chicken is super flavorful as well, and is prepared in a panko-style, which is obviously still fried but doesn't feel as naughty as making a KFC run.\n\nThe portion is very decent and filling; I've had this for lunch around 1 and literally not been hungry for the rest of the day. I think the price point is a LITTLE high even given the quality and portion - with tip, this runs you a little over $20, when it should really be closer to $17ish in my opinion for a quicker sit-down meal - but it's certainly not as egregious as some other places in the neighborhood. The wait time can also be all over the place, depending on the staff and the number of customers. I've had a handful of instances where I've ordered and gotten my food within 30 seconds. Perfect. I've also had occasions where it's taken 10 minutes or so. If time is a concern, I'd go on a Friday when the crowd has thinned out for the weekend (this spot is a little too far removed from the tourist areas to really have much of a demographic beyond nearby office workers).\n\nUrban Space in general has been a positive.
