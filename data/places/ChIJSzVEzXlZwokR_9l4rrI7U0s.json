My time off limb had led to doubt and self-questioning, but with Anthony I got to speak my piece and felt I was a partner in creating the new, ideal limb, not just a patient ready to take what was offered.

And these were not always the latest gizmos, but rather a selection of old and new technologies that were customized to my particular, and often particularly frustrating, circumstances.\n\nBecause of my previous fit issues we moved slowly and carefully, and managed to avoid setbacks. I have been able to reach out to him directly as needed, and when a fit issue comes up, I am able to see him quickly (usually the next day). He's good about text communications too--sometimes you don't need a visit, but just reassurance or advice on a particular matter.\n\nIn terms of East Coast Prosthetics, I will say that the offices are not particularly great. I had initially checked their location on Broadway in Washington Heights, and I was completely underwhelmed by the shabby office and the disinterested response to my questions. When I started working with Anthony and first visited the 2nd Ave/19th St location, I was shocked at the condition of the facilities--the staff never rolls up the security gates, so the place looks and feels a bit like a prison. The exam rooms are small, there is no adequate place to do test walks, and the walls are marked or damaged and badly in need of painting. It would be great if they put a little more TLC into the facilities."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Anthony Marano at East Coast Prosthetics has given me the best prosthetic experience I have had in my 30-plus years as an amputee.
