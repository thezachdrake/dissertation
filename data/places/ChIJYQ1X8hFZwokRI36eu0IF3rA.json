The experience was standard: line up outdoors, metal detector, and bag search, followed by waiting in the lobby and having the option to buy a show trinket from the gift cart. Finally, you get seated and get the Gelman warmup. If you get top tier of their two tier audience section, your screwed out of most of the experience. The hosts barely address the upper tier of the audience. Arriving earlier to get seated on the bottom tier is WORTH IT! We were in direct eye contact with Kelly and Mark from our seats. Delightful experience. One star comes off for the hosts taking a long 45 minute (atleast) break before coming back out to pretape a small segment. People who attended just for the live show wanted to leave, and staff was begrudgingly escorting them out in groups.
