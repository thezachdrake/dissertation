We then had the black bean burger (formerly veganator) it had Seitan, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, vegan cheese, pickles, and a TRUE black-bean burger! This was no franken-beyond-previously-known-as-food  here. It was delightful. Fyi- I do love a good beyond/morningstar burger at times.\nBut this burger! made with black beans and brown rice (per the menu), it was perfectly blended smooth, and EVERY bite was delicious. Now, I did remove the pickles as Im just not a pickle-in-my-food kinda girl. I had to try the seitan by itself in order to really taste it, but overall, I was NOT disappointed. It was a good burger. And even better, you dont need ketchup! I tried it with and without. Also, the burger came with fries....meh. It was a GrubHub order, and the order came quickly. However, unless my fries are piping hot, it doesn't matter where I get them from. I won't be impressed. I would def recommend anyone out there to give this place a try. Look at their menu and decide.
