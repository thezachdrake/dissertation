I will always and forever be grateful to Dr.Radjabi and Lauren. They have been with me since day one I stepped in that office. Never have I ever felt like they are ignoring my needs. Every time I would go for my appointments I felt loved and very well taken care like the first day.I will recommend this doctor to anyone who really want to start a family but doesn’t know where to start or what treatments they need. He got answers for every concern you have. He is very patient and never gets annoyed from asking questions. Nurse Lauren also is there for you and will answer any questions or unclarity you might have. Laure is an Angel ❤️. Please ignore all those negative comments because I guarantee you that those reviews are false.Guys let’s be realistic he is one doctor and has a lot of patients. All patients wants to be seen by him . How can he see all his patients at the same time? I never experienced any long wait. Try to be more understanding and be more patient . It is worth the wait! BELIEVE ME!!!!!\nIt took me forever to find a good fertility doctor. I went to so many doctors for my pcos. Every doctor would give me either birth control or Metformin and call it a day. Dr Radjabi didn’t waist my time prescribing me Metformin instead he had to go under a surgery that removed my cyst. I had pain constantly, but after Doctor Radjabi removed my cyst I felt like I was free again.I am very picky when it comes to women health and trust me you will never ever find a better doctor than him. The stuff is wonderful . The doctor and the nurse Lauren are good hearted people than genuinely care for their patients! If you have Pcos don’t waist your time , but go visit him and you will thank me Later ! Me and my Husband will forever be grateful to him and Lauren ❤️!!!!
