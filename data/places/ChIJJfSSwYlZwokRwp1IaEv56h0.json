All the pets are well cared and held in clean conditions. They have glass doors in the rooms for transparency. I’m so happy that we were able to adopt our Loki the same day. It took us about 1,5 h to go through application process and I think it’s great that they are taking time to make sure the pet is given in good hands. We had a pet carrier bag with us and we took our Loki home right away. We paid the fee and they even gave us package of food for the cat to make adaptation process smoother as moving to a new home is already stressful. The first days Loki was hiding and didn’t eat much but we made sure to give him some time and space. Right now he is the owner of the house, playing , having fun and exploring his first Christmas tree. We’re very grateful for our newest family member! Highly recommend this shelter!
