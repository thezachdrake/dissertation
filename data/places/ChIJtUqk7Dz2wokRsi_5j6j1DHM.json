V&T is very popular with the Columbia University crowd as it sits in the vicinity of its campus and across from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and Mt. Sinai Hospital. Friday and Saturday nights tend to be particularly busy, but you won't wait long at all. In fact, I've never had to wait for a table in 50 years.
