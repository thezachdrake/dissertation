His inquiries about my husband’s conditions, such as pre-diabetes, spinal stenosis, and hip replacement surgery led to insights into his recovery, walking, balance, physical therapy, and diet. Dr. Chien’s helpful opinions about the latest pressure socks, foot gadgets, and sneakers were always useful and sometimes humorous.
