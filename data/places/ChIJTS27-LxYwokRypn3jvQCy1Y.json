Since then, running has become a huge business and runners have gotten a lot more support to help achieve their running goals.  Three years ago, I discovered the Mile High Running Club.  They opened a new location on the Upper East Side of Manhattan which I've been associated with ever since.  Runners who join receive time-tested running advice from world-class athletes who have excelled in the sport.  There is a low-lit studio that conducts challenging running workouts on high-tech treadmills.  Lively music is pumped into these sessions that is geared to motivate those who participate.  For those training for distance races such as half and full marathons, the location has a weekly Saturday morning long-run gathering where several professional pacers lead runners at various pace groups throughout Central Park.  Each runner has their own customized training plan that is based on their ability.  After you enter Mile High from the street entrance, you're greeted to a very clean and well-organized business.  Runners take a staircase down to the lower level where most of the club is located.  There you will find gender-neutral bathrooms, changing rooms and showers.  Each shower has is own private stall with a locking door.  The opened sink and mirror area is amply-supplied with various bathroom toiletries that runners may need before and after their runs.  Towels, shampoo, and body wash are provided for runners for the showers as well as blow dryers.  The showers provide a very fine, refreshing, and enrionment-friendly hot mist that's unlike any shower I ever took.  Throughout the Club, there are many signs to show that this place is very environment-friendly.  There are various recycling containers throughout the club for landfill, recyclables, and even for used running shoes.  The place also has a sign asking runners to request a bath towel at the front desk (this helps prevent those who waste towels: totally understandable!).  There are plenty of lockers available for runners to store their gear during their workouts.  A giant 9-foot monthly calendar on the wall shows runners upcoming races and featured workouts happening throughout each month.  For runners of all shapes, sizes, and speeds, the Mile High Running Club is definitely a home away from home.  As a life-long runner, this place has made me fall in love with running all over again."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"As a life-long runner with 37+ years of running under my belt, I grew up during a time where the only help one could receive for their running was from running books written by those who have mastered the sport (i.e., Jim Fixx's The Complete Book of Running comes to mind).
