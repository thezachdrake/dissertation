I wouldn't be here without her, and I am strong as an oak. I don't typically post reviews but after years working together on rough stuff, she is the most caring, gifted, incisive, impactful and incredible doctor (AND human being in the medical field) I've ever met in my life. She is no 'life coach' or someone who perpetuates why you are seeking therapy in the first place. She doesn't need the money. There was a waiting list when I first met her and she has an extraordinarily vast client base. You're lucky if you get on her calendar. She'll never toot her own horn so I will. So many doctors in her world just act like numb, tired lumps with notebooks and rattle off the 'de rigueur' of questions without really listening. Dr. Berdy will make you feel comfortable from your first meeting. It's almost impossible to find a connection with a clinical therapist, especially one with such a renowned reputation as hers. She's both wise and humble... and as you get to know her, really funny and deeply committed - if you are willing to do the work and be honest. She doesn't judge one bit. All of these traits are extremely rare. As a public figure I was initially guarded and thought I had all the answers (just needed some guidance). But, we found synergy immediately through a trusted NYC referral and it was like having lasik surgery each week with her... where after a few sessions I saw crystal clearly who - and what - was the root of the issues I was facing. IOW, the genesis of everything troubling me, personally and professionally. I found peace, healing and real answers that required me to accept what I had not even considered before, which is difficult. She'll give you the unvarnished truth when you give her the real deal... it hurts, but damn does it save you time. She doesn't lead. She asks and you'll come to the realization (unless you're an obtuse idiot) and gives you actual solutions, asks real questions, not what you want to hear. Dr. Berdy is so profoundly experienced, sharp, observant, and changed the entire course of my life. I'm so blessed to have crossed her path and have her in my life."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr. Michele Berdy dives deeply.
