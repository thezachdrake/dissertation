I made a call before showing up around 10am and Spoke to a older hispanic Mami and i asked her if i can wash my clothes at home because i do have a washer but would i be able to come in and DRY my clothes there and she told me YES i can. So i washed everything packed it all up into my Cart and walked there with my young Daughter to DRY our clothes to only be told by the Heavy set guy that works there i can’t dry my clothes because i didn’t wash there !! even after i told him i Called and the lady told me i can. So after i called the morning of did all my washing i had to leave and search for another laundry then ask them to dry my clothes after walking and walking i found a place that was very far away from the area i live!

So i then proceeded to walk out the store because i’m finished doing my laundry but right before i left, the store had a handful of folks standing around and they all witnessed me ask this Guy hey i thought you turned me away and told me that you can’t dry here if you didn’t wash here but i literally just watched as you allow this woman to do so...
