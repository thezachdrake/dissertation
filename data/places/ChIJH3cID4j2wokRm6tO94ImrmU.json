Not only did he attend every appearance for 4 years, appear and facilitate all communication throughout and after mediation, and file winning motions, but he also did a trial during which he skillfully cross-examined the opposing party.  Ultimately, the decision after trial was in our favor and the Court ruled that we were entitled to everything we asked for. Seth is the most caring, honest, and passionate attorney I’ve ever met.
