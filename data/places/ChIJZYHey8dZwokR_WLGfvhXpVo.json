I've spent a lot of time and money in this store, though, up until today, I've only been there during the week. We live around the corner and my girls enjoy going. We took my niece, sister, and Mom with us today to make custom bracelets. You'll note it's obviously a pretty pricey endeavor, as you have to pay to just even sit at their table, in addition to the bracelets. We helped the girls string their bracelets, but then it came time to close them, and they insisted they needed to do it. They came back to size them to the girls, they insisted we take off some of the beads because they said they'd be too big, and then they went off to close them... which, frankly, took a while. When they finally brought them back they were entirely too tight, making marks on the girls arms. At this point there were still ten minutes left on the clock they put in front of you... Which, you know, is also a bit tacky.  Anyway, they refused to help us make them any bigger. They not only refused but each employee came over to offer their snide remarks, their unwillingness to help, their absolutely rude comments on the kids who were a bit cranky at this point, and passive aggressive wishes that we'll come back. My mom and sis quickly strung their beads and we left before our time was up. Their bracelets are too big, the girls' are too tiny, sadly. We were also yelled at that the place is not for young kids, that we should have helped the kids more, they were way too busy to spend any more time on us, it was all our fault we have no bracelets that fit, and now we have no bracelets to wear. I'm not sure what the ages of the kids have to do with the bracelets not fitting. I also don't understand how I was supposed to fix the length situation when they're the ones fitting the bracelets and finishing them. It also seems to me that if you have time left on your clock, nobody is waiting for a table spot, nobody is waiting to check out and you have five people on staff who have enough time to hang around and yell at you, then maybe it should be ok for them to use that time to help you fix the bracelets before you leave. This whole experience is also pretty contrary to the entire mantra of the brand I think that folks should be kind? Who knows. Maybe the staff aren't trained properly? Aren't paid well? I don't know. Either way, I can't recommend making bracelets there. Just purchasing on a week day when their staff isn't totally frazzled and much nicer is probably the way to go. 😔"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Today was pretty sad.
