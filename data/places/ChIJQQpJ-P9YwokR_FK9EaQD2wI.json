I get that this location is small and only offers limited services, but that's not what makes this place bad- its really the people. This location is the closest one to my place of work, and I often find myself needing to print documents on my way to and from work as well as on my meal breaks. In my experience, the people here are unfriendly and pretty visibly uninterested in their work or helping their customers. The woman I find myself interacting with the most hardly interacts with me at all. She shows little to no concern for whatever issues I may be dealing with while I'm there, and walks slowly from place to place around the location, presumably to avoid doing work. If something I'm paying for gets done wrong and I ask her to correct it, she huffs and rolls her eyes before taking steps to fix the problem. When the place gets busy she ignores most of the customers and doesn't say a word to her multiple coworkers who can be heard loudly laughing and talking in the back. I've visited this location a number of times over the past few months and this is a recurring thing here.\n\nAnd that's all on top of the many technical issues the place has. Their self-service printers are often offline or failing to establish a connection, making their print-and-go services almost useless. I've had to resubmit documents simply because the machine couldn't establish a strong enough connection to download my documents properly. Even printing from a flash drive can be a hassle. Today, as I printed documents from my flash drive, the machine indicated that there were issues while printing one of my files. I went through the process of resending documents multiple times as the machine charged me for each failed print. I would have asked for a refund on my failed prints, but the same woman I mentioned above was on the clock, and I'm sure she would have been too helpless to refund me.\n\nFrom now on I'll just plan the extra blocks it'll take to walk to another location into my lunch break or commute to work.
