I had at that time strawberries with some peach on a crêpe, and it was awesome. My son had a savory ham and cheese crêpe, and it tasted great.\n\nThis time around, I came with my daughter and my sister-in-law. We had Nutella crêpes with strawberry and also one with strawberry and banana, and they tasted amazing. However, I have to add that the customer service was not top-notch as it was before. Very negative at the beginning, first impressions. I would’ve left with the greeting that we received; the tone we were greeted in was not pleasant, and we were shooed away outside. Second impression, the same. My sister-in-law had a wobbly table, and her drink fell. I went inside to get paper towels, and when I told them about the incident, their response was less than satisfactory.\n\nTheir remark, \"Oh, you made a mess?\" came across as dismissive and unprofessional. I answered, \"Well, yes, on your wobbly table.\" If it wasn't for my daughter needing or wanting food, we would have left. In addition, the waiter behind the counter seemed very angry and didn't seem to like what they were doing. It made us feel as though our presence and satisfaction weren't important to them. We felt uncomfortable and unwelcome.\n\nOn a positive note, our food waiter was very nice and attentive. He greeted us nicely and provided great service. If it weren't for the unpleasant experience with the others, we would have had a great time. However, considering the overall experience, I won't be returning to Crepes on Columbus. It's a shame because the crêpes themselves were exceptional in taste and quality. But the combination of the unwelcoming attitude, dismissive response to the spill, and the lack of attention from certain staff members has left a lasting negative impression.\n\nI sincerely hope that the management takes these concerns seriously and works on improving the customer service aspect to match the outstanding food they serve."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"First impression: Last time I was here, it was probably about 10 years ago, and it was absolutely amazing.
