With my Son it has been great. My son been with the daycare since he was 6 months old. At first I was very nervous and scared because you hear so many bad rumors about putting you child in daycare. But I had to go back to work and I had no one to take care of my child so I have no choice. But surprisingly it was the best experience for my son and I. My son never leaves there with a wet or dirty diaper. He felt in love with each teacher he was given, from Lisa to Kim to Anna and Shannon and now with Ms. Em who he adores dearly. They each took care of my child as if he was their own. They learned my child likes and dislikes and  how to put him to sleep with ease. And they always make sure he eats. I was very scared with that. Once my son gets there he jumps out his stroller to run to them and his peers. He has made many of friends and it has help in even on the outside when I take him to the park. He has learn to share and draw. Art and crafts which he loves. Every month he comes home with a big folder with all the work he did in that past month. They take them on trips and to the park. I cannot said anything bad because they have been so good to my son and I. Even the staff Rosa and Stephanie. I appreciate each and every one of you ladies and I am so happy Knowing my son is at such a safe place. Most importantly you want people who gonna take care of your child with love because taking care of children is not an easy job. You need to have major patiences and love what you do. I recommend this daycare to all parents. Especially if they start there from young, the younger the better. Thank you friends and family"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I just want to say everyone experience is different. With my Son it has been great.
