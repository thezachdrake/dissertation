The fact that this parking garage's negligence had cost me such a significant amount of money was beyond infuriating. I reached out to them multiple times, leaving messages and trying to initiate contact, but it was as if my attempts were falling into a void. They blatantly ignored my calls and even worse, showed no interest in responding to my insurance company's inquiries.\n\nThe complete lack of accountability and professionalism displayed by this garage is absolutely appalling. Not only did they fail to properly maintain their facility, but they also engaged in deliberate actions to hide their wrongdoings. The fact that they have chosen to evade responsibility, avoid communication, and leave me to bear the brunt of the financial consequences speaks volumes about their utter disregard for their customers.\n\nI cannot emphasize strongly enough how terrible my experience with MP parking was.
