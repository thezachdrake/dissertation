I was told it would take 7 days and while it seemed odd not to take a deposit, I obliged. He told me he would call when the art was ready.\n\n14 days later I had not received a call. I went back to the store and luckily the pieces were ready. I reviewed 2 of the 3 in the store and took them home.

Never pay the full amount up front when you are leaving valuable art in someone else's possession, especially if they have yet to provide the service. $1600 may not be a lot of money to him as the store owner, but he treated me appallingly, making my purchase seem unimportant and irrelevant for his business.\n\nI left with damaged artwork, having spent $1600 with no offer of even partial compensation for the trouble he had caused me.
