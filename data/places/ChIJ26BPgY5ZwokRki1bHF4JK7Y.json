First glance at the building really just takes you away, it’s better in person than in pictures or videos. A small line was already formed when I got there, but I was able to get into the store under 15-20 minutes. Also,  the traffic at the corner where the store is situated at can get a little hectic, so keep that in mind if you plan to take pictures of the exterior (aka, be on a sidewalk). That being said, employees don’t allow photographing inside the store. They make it very clear either when you get yelled at or someone else does, lol. Inside the store looks amazing, really bright and (somewhat??) minimalistic. A deck wall complements the back of house. As for the products, I was surprised that Supreme carries other skate branded clothing. I was also taken aback by how much product they have in stock from past weekly releases and even past seasons. Keep in mind I went during sale season so that might have to do something with it, but most of the clothes were stuff that nobody wanted to buy (at least for full price) during the season, which might explain the return of some items. You also aren’t charged sales tax for items that are on sale. Definitely an essential visit if you’re touring NYC, or are looking to build your collection."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve been buying Supreme online for years and today was the first time I was in an actual store location.
