I am a lover of flowers, I have supported local florists for nearly two decades in New Jersey, Boston, and DC. Bill is not your average florist. He is an architect of flowers. He is this compelling conductor and curator of light, joy, and passion. He doesn't only take the time to listen to what you are looking for but he offers this wild range of flowers that I have never heard of or seen before. He sits with you and listens to why you are buying the flowers and orchestrates flowers to honor your loved one and the occasion. As if that wasn't enough, this lovely soul helped me to co-write the message that goes on the card. The fact that he knew exactly what I wanted to say and how was undoubtedly the sweetest thing ANY florist I have ever worked with has ever done. He was deeply attentive. He was beyond kind. Also, the price range fit my budget. His flower selection is international and it's the most beautiful buffet of options available. His work is magic because HE is magic. He is intentional and purposeful and THAT is who you want arranging flowers for your loved ones.\n\nHe gave me his time, his energy, his words, his light. I do *not* often write reviews, but Bill and his future customers need to know the level of care and warmth that he provides - it is in complete abundance. Call up Flower Fashion, and you probably won't need to ask for Bill because you will recognize him by his cheerful voice.
