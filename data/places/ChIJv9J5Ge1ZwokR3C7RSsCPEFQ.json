They also pay them minimum wage while overcharging clients. What is highly disturbing about this company, the \"higher up's\", executives and the corporation itself receives a very large and disproportionate share from their clients and very little goes to the workers. The company where I used to work was a client of Velocity for over five years. My company used them for in-house and outside messaging, mail room and other office solutions. In the beginning they used to charge us close to $20,000 a month for eleven workers. The costs however went up 10% every year, plus they reduced the amount of workers at our site while the price steadily kept rising. Velocity's justification for raising the price whilst eliminating workers was that they needed to raise other workers' pay and also pay for their benefits in which case never occurred at all. We asked the Velocity workers at our office for their pay stubs and what we found was absolutely appalling and disgusting. Some of their workers were receiving (at the time in 2003) $6.50/hour. What was also very disturbing the workers did not receive any sick, personal or vacation time and many of them have not received any raises. The other sickening part to this the workers were not technically employees of Velocity. They were  technically outsourced by another company called \"TBM\". TBM acts an outsourcing company enlisting all their \"employees\" mostly lower level workers as \"Time Service Employees\".   After some research my company found out that TBM is actually Velocity. Velocity is using TBM as a guise so not to pay their workers' benefits nor give them any raises at all. When we asked Velocity about this  they told us they'll get back to us so to correspond with their corporate office to see what was going on in which they never did. Velocity Express is very dishonest and a very unethical employer. The corporation itself lies and cheat both the client and the workers just so they can make a profit. It's no wonder why the messengers are so unprofessional and always upset. It is because of Velocity itself. My advice to any company or individual, do not use this company at all unless you want a poor representation of yourself and your business."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Velocity Express abuses their employees, mostly messengers, couriers and other low level and less-skilled workers.
