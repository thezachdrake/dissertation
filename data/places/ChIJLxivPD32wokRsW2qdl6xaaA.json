You need to wait outside!” I let him know his coworker kindly told me to pull in because it was too hard for me to reverse back out into traffic when in such a crowded, narrow tunnel filled with cars. He repeated his demands for me to reverse out.  It seemed as if he was projecting and taking out anger on his customer, which is unacceptable. I asked to speak to his manager and he claimed he was the manager, but I think he was making this up, as it’s hard for me to believe that an experienced manager would treat customers this way. In the end, after canceling my reservation that would’ve started 2 minutes later, I managed to do a tight u-turn instead of reversing out into traffic.
