I was told they thought I had moved out because my furniture was gone, but I still had belongings in the closets as my lease was not up… I had emailed Matel prior to my vacation letting them know my official move out date and it was acknowledged via email, yet this date was ignored by staff and entry occurred without my knowledge.
