Immaculate facilities, ultra professional staff, short wait times between various testing/counseling, and fully capable of providing any vaccination required.  I went in because I was concerned about one thing, but ended up doing all the tests/shots.  Was in and out in 1:45. It is a NYC DoH clinic so services are free at the time but they ask you to pay afterwards on a sliding scale on the honor system tied to your income (which they do not verify).  Maximum requested payment is $50.  I was so pleased with everything that when I got home I could not put the $50 in the mail fast enough.  Near impossible to believe it is a public clinic, it's nicer than lots of private medical offices I have been in."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the place to go if you are concerned about anything.
