I chose studio 16 since I only wanted personal training and didn’t want the hidden fees other gyms came with. I was a little nervous because the studio is pretty new and personal training is not cheap, but after the consultation call with Nate I decided to give it a chance. Nate kindly let me try out 2 trainers before making a decision.\n\nI worked with Anthony for 6 months and cannot recommend him enough. Anthony was very knowledgeable about building muscle, nutrition, and making adjustments for injuries. One time, he posted me on his Instagram story when I hit a PR (I don’t use Instagram but it was a sweet gesture). Ultimately, I met my goals and gained a lot more confidence getting back into a routine. I only discontinued because I wanted to take group classes and studio 16 is just personal training.\n\nTo be honest, the studio is not perfect. There’s not as much equipment as a regular gym because there is less space. Also, sometimes trainers hold slots even when people cancel, which can be frustrating if you need to move your session. However, I will say the business is REALLY well run. One time, the ceiling started leaking during my workout and by the time the workout ended, Nate had already fixed the leak (this was at 6am in the middle of the winter!). The good news is they’re getting a bigger space in Hell’s Kitchen so hopefully that helps the space and availability problems.\n\nI would definitely work out here in the future.
