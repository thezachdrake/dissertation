I travel around the US for hiking and photography and knew this minimal design would compliment my ways of walking and free up pockets for lite treks and especially for everyday happenings.  It was the best travel souvenir I have invested in in a long while based on three factors:  metropolitan style, functionality and follow through.  I was back in the City this past weekend for museums and music and saw a paste poster ad for Smith + Parka while walking bridges on the way into the city.  I knew I had to stop by and say hello with sling in tow.  David was at it, working on a product and looked up with a smile of recognition. After catching up a moment I shared how pleased I was with it and it’s everyday use, even offering a suggestion to add a little inside paracord for tucking/clasping keys to they don’t move around and scratch glasses or phone screens.  Without hesitation, he offered to make that happen right on the spot. That’s customer service at 200% in my world. He just wanted to make it right and did so with grace and kindness while we explored the market around him.  My friend was so impressed that later that evening she shared she’s going to purchase one for herself!
