Everyone knows going to the Doctor, it is generally not cheap.\n\nI took her to Heart of Chelsea because it was located in my neighborhood and they were able to make an appointment the same day.\n\nFrom the time I walked into the door my anxiety slowly started to go away. The receptionists were very nice and handed me a clipboard to fill out all of necessary information. It wasn't an excessive amount of paperwork like some places seem to require. They had a little cooler with little bottles of water that you could take if you were feeling a little parched, and I was thirsty. That was really nice and convenient.\n\nThe receptionist/assistant brought me into the room without much of a wait at all. We got to the blood work and everything started right away. They took a look at her teeth which is what we all suspected was the major issue. Dr. Torchia came in and we discussed that what she had was a disease where her teeth were bothering her and they had to be removed. Of course I was concerned about the costs, and they were very good about explaining how much everything would cost - and the  cost ended up being a couple of hundred dollars cheaper than the high end of the estimate.\n\nI called around to a few other places, and even had a hard time getting some idea that's how much things would cost if they be able to see me or even if they had the equipment available to them. I decided that I really liked the way we were treated at Heart of Chelsea and decided to go to Heart of Chelsea and have them do the surgery on Tiny.\n\nDr. Nguyen did the surgery at their 18th street location.  Went smoothly, and they explained aftercare for her.  Apparently Dr. Nguyen did a great job! Now she is happy, and eating, and playful, and enjoying sunshine in the window!\n\nWe had a follow-up appointment yesterday. And rather than being anxiety-inducing, it was an absolute pleasure to be there. I am pretty sure Tiny likes Dr. Torchha - they even took a picture together! He's become one of my favorite people too!\n\nSince Tiny's surgery I have broken my foot. When I was there  yesterday the staff was doing everything they could to help me around with my crutches, holding doors open for me everywhere and even offering to help me get a car to take me home.\n\nIncredible people work there and they go above and beyond for their customers whether  their customers have two legs or four legs! I will be bringing my other two cats there as well!\n\nIf you want to feel good about where you're taking your pet and you want the best possible care from people who aren't trying to rob you- go to Heart of Chelsea!

He's become one of my favorite people too!\n\nSince Tiny's surgery I have broken my foot. When I was there  yesterday the staff was doing everything they could to help me around with my crutches, holding doors open for me everywhere and even offering to help me get a car to take me home.\n\nIncredible people work there and they go above and beyond for their customers whether  their customers have two legs or four legs! I will be bringing my other two cats there as well!\n\nIf you want to feel good about where you're taking your pet and you want the best possible care from people who aren't trying to rob you- go to Heart of Chelsea! You want to know where the love is? It's at Heart of Chelsea! Also, they have cool swag :)"},"publishTime":"2019-06-27T15:40:06Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.763234080291504,"longitude":-73.9913198197085},"low":{"latitude":40.760536119708505,"longitude":-73.9940177802915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":1,"hour":8,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":19,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":8,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":19,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":8,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":19,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":8,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":19,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":8,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":18,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":9,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":18,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Saturday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Sunday: Closed"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"453 W 46th St, New York"}
