The students are generally smart kids with some kind of issue that would make it difficult if not impossible for them to thrive at a regular public school.  The small class size and incredibly dedicated staff create miracles for the 300 or so lucky boys and girls who go here.  And it's K-12, meaning the school can invest in the students long-term, getting to know how they learn and addressing their individual educational and social needs. There was a tough year or two in there for TCS when there was a different school director, who wasn't the right fit.  Now, the principal of the high school is in charge of the whole place, and TCS/LHS definitely has found its mojo again.  There are only a handful of schools like TCS in New York City, but I suspect none of the others have such beautiful facilities, including a gorgeous view out the Roosevelt Island windows. But it's the staff that makes the school what it is.  The teachers, therapists and support staff are giving and caring people who go the extra mile for their students.  Not a day goes by when I don't count my lucky stars that my child goes to The Child School.
