The other patrons seemed all very immersed in their experiences as well.  That added to the overall welcoming atmosphere.  Our seating was a little too low for the height of the table but we quickly got used to it.   I sampled everything from a well crafted family style prix fixe menu. The appetizers were my favorites.  Each one was delectable. The entrees were delightful as well.  However, I found the honey and caramel sauces on some of the dishes were a little overpowering.  Of the desserts, the carrot cake caught my attention…moist and velvety and not too sweet. There was a photographer with a very keen eye who captured some amazing shots to immortalize the moments…for a prize of course.  But they were worth it.  I would definitely come back and next time spend some time at the bar too.
