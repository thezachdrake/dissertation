I had transferred at the end of my second trimester after a horrible experience with my first OB and then being abroad a couple months.\n\nComing to Oula was like a sigh of relief. I was listened to, I had choices, I was genuinely cared for. I love that Oula has the Fresh Test option for the glucose tolerance or the option to monitor with glucometer. I chose Fresh Test as it was super easy.\n\nThe office is definitely warming, the comfy couches, the welcoming receptionist with water and snacks! My previous OB claimed a spa-like environment but it honestly had nothing. Oula was actually wonderful to visit and sit in the waiting room, although you never wait long! I have never even finished a snack before being called back.\n\nEvery nurse I met along the way was wonderful. I'm an anxious patient and the nurses talked to me and always made me laugh and smile. The midwives are nothing short of amazing. They all **spent ample time with me**. As someone with questions and concerns, they never dismissed me or cut me short. They always looked into things and offered full explanations. AND they followed up with me every time.\n\nMy labor was terrible, I had prodromal contractions for 5 days before the real deal and showed up to the hospital 7 cm dilated and was shocked since I was going to ask for an induction I was so tired. Although the hospital took forever to get me into the room and the postpartum nurses at Mount Sinai were actually quite terrible, my Oula midwives that delivered my baby and came to check on me postpartum were still amazing.\n\nThe postpartum checks with Oula were also very reassuring. I had a third degree tear so I had a 2 week check up to make sure I was healing well. I had pretty bad postpartum depression and the midwife spent a whole hour with me going through everything and offering multiple suggestions and following up with me twice after I left. I had another virtual visit before my in person 6 week check up for lactation help and another lengthy helpful 6 week visit.\n\nI was super sad that was the end of my Oula journey. It almost makes me want to have another baby just so I can have the entire pregnancy journey with them this time!\n\nSo happy to hear they are extending for more OB care!\n\n10/10 recommend Oula!\nAlso I have Oscar insurance and only needed to pay $100 for everything."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Now that I've completed my journey with Oula, I can write a comprehensive review.\n\nI loved Oula from start to end.
