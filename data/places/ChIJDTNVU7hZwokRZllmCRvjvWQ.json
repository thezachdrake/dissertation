is rare to find someone who does both massage and acupuncture as well as Jeff. I went to him for both, and was so pleased with his treatment that I continued to have sessions with him. At each session, he listens carefully to my descriptions of what is bothering me, and he always gives due weight to what I say, while also uncovering through his own skill the source of my discomfort. He is skilled at reading pulses, as acupuncturists are trained to do. (Although not all acupuncturists are good at reading pulses, Jeff most certainly is.) He has strong fingers and hands, applying just the right amount of pressure when he massages. I was happy to find a massage therapist who  primarily uses his fingers and hands to massage, rather than relying on the side of his arm for many strokes, as some massage therapists do.  I find that where the massage therapist uses their fingers and hands, as Jeff does, rather than their forearms, the massage is much more effective at relieving any tightness and trigger points. All told, I am very pleased to have found an acupuncturist/massage therapist who is as dedicated as Jeff is to the wellbeing of his patients.
