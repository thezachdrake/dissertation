However, I arrived at 9:45am on a Saturday for my 10:00am appointment and no one was there. I waited and tried the doors at 9:55, nothing. 10:00am I called and it went to voicemail, 10:02am same thing and I noticed all the lights were off. Finally around 5 after, Dr. Folickman shows up and lets us both in and has me start filling out paper work while he's booting up the computers and turning on the lights. Another couple minutes go by and the technician shows up who takes over while he goes to get ready. I went back there before there was even a receptionist and it felt very rushed and unprofessional. During the visit, Dr. Folickman told me there was a Flouride treatment they offer now but it's not covered and it's $45. I said \"Okay\", acknowledging I was listening. The appointment goes on and as the technician is having me rinse and prepare for X-rays she hands me a small cup of blue liquid and tells me to swish for 30 seconds. I do so, and spit. Then upon checking out, the receptionist says it will be $45 and I asked \"For what?\" and the receptionist said it was my copay. Clearly she didn't have the information as she was late to work. But the technician overheard and said \"The flouride treatment you said you wanted\". I was very confused as I never agreed to it, but simply knew that it was an option and I was never once offered this, but it was sort of forced on me. The receptionist went on to complain to me about my card not swiping and I had to tell her it was a chip card. Then she also told me to schedule my \"30 minute appointment\" and I asked again \"For what?\" and she rolled her eyes and said \"You should have discussed this with him.\" Well, I obviously didn't and she's scheduling me for an appointment that even she doesn't know what it's for. Eventually she finds out it's for \"bonded fillings\" which was something he casually mentioned to me. After finding out how much it cost I immediately said I'd call back and reschedule at a later date. I just wanted out of there. Nothing was clear. The three of them were late to work at 10:00am on Saturday. I was charged for something I didn't agree to. AND there was no sort of receipt for anything. Not what was covered by insurance, not that I had a cleaning, not anything but a small credit card receipt that just read $45.00. I will definitely be looking elsewhere for a dentist."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr. Folickman was a really nice guy and his \"bedside manner\" was great.
