We embarked on the Birthplace Place of Hip Hop bus tour. We purchased tickets online prior to. This tour starts at the Museum of the City of New York. It began promptly at 11 AM after all of the guests were gathered. You are allowed to take a bathroom break at the start of the tour at the museum. Rayza was our tour guide who is a popular rapper in the New York City area. He was very lively, entertaining, and knowledgeable about New York and Hip Hop culture. When we started our tour, we began across from the projects. Rayza told us an interesting story about a man who had an alligator and a crocodile that the SWAT team had to get out of his apartment. Once we made our way down the street, we went to the Graffiti Wall of Fame. This is where many talented graffiti artists have tagged the wall with their amazing art. This was at a schoolyard playground where we watched a performance by another Hush Hip Hop tour employee. The employee was Mighty Mouse who performed a breakdancing set for us. He also had a class of volunteers, who he taught how to do a simple breakdance routine. This was also where we met our main tour guide, which was Reggie Rich. Reggie Rich is a pioneer in the hip-hop game! He has had famous rappers such as Jay Z and LL Cool J sample his work in the past. After this, we made our way to the charter tour bus. Along the way, we learned about the four elements of hip-hop which include: DJing, Breakdancing, Graffiti art, and the MC. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to hear Rayza and Reggie Reg speaking during our charter bus ride. This was because Rayza didn’t have a microphone headset. Also Reggie Reg’s microphone wasn’t that adequate in sound. Our first stop was Apollo Theater. We learned a bit about the history of the start of Apollo, which has showcased many hip-hop artists. Apollo Theater is a notable landmark and attraction in New York City. Our second stop was Rucker Park. This is where many notable basketball legends have played street-ball. Throughout the years, these players have shown their talent extends past the professional basketball courts. Basketball greats who have played here include: Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James to name a few. There are also many tournaments that have been held here and it is a staple of the Harlem community. We learned that Harlem has the best street ball. Our third stop was Yankee Stadium. We learned the old Giants Stadium was originally in Harlem, but now Yankee Stadium is in its current site in the Bronx. Throughout each of these stops, the Hush Hip Hop tours employees took group photos of all of us together. We did have a bit of time to take our own photos at each stop, which Reggie Ridge encouraged. The Hush Hip Hop tour staff was very engaging with us on the bus. We did chants, the employees rapped, tour participants rapped, and they played Hip Hop music. We also got vital information on Hip Hop history and culture. This includes knowledge about founding figures that have pioneered the genre. The tour guides continued to reiterate that Hip Hop was supposedly founded on August 11, 1973. Our fourth stop that was the birthplace of Hip Hop. We were able to go to the actual building where DJ Herc had the first Hip Hop party. He’s also the first to do the breaking of a record. They have a beautiful mural in the space where he hosted the Hip Hop party, which we were able to take photos of. There’s also a Hip Hop Blvd sign right in front of the building. Rayza stated he would send all of the photos from our tour day if we DM’d him on Instagram, which we attempted to do. This was our last stop before we were dropped off in Manhattan. The overwhelming theme of this tour is Hip Hop is a culture and genre. We greatly enjoyed this tour, but feel the tour guides definitely need to have better microphones and sound systems. I would recommend this tour to anyone in New York who would like to celebrate Hip Hop as a genre and learn even more about this amazing culture!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We participated in this black owned company’s tour on Saturday, August 13, 2022.

We were fully entertained throughout the journey through  the history of hip hop and the wonderful and colourful culture It has created. We visited important historical areas of New York that no one should miss. Harlem, Brooklyn, The Bronx.\nThis was the best 3 hours ever spent…. And… even if hip hop is not your thing (🤷‍♀️) this is still one tour  not to be missed.\nThank you Hush tours for the best day spent."},"publishTime":"2023-05-25T08:53:42Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7939636302915,"longitude":-73.9507511197085},"low":{"latitude":40.79126566970851,"longitude":-73.9534490802915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":9,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":18,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":10,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":18,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":10,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":18,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":10,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":18,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":10,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":18,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":10,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":18,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":9,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":18,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Thursday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Friday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Saturday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Sunday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"1220 Fifth Avenue 104th &, E 103rd St, New York"}
