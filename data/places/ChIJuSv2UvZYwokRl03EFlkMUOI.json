possible. I came for a consultation due to a past injury leaving my front tooth chipped. I came to find out, from the doctor assigned to me, that my bite was too tight to add any length to my chipped tooth. She then proceeded to pressure me into getting porcelain veneers. The only problem was she would have to shave down half my tooth structure, which didn’t seem like a great option to me in my mind, considering I’m only 22 and my teeth are healthy besides the chip. She used nasty sales tactics such as belittling and criticizing my appearance in hopes of making money off of my insecurities (which I acknowledge is unfortunately common in the cosmetic industry). I’m an actress and she told me i would look extremely better on camera with this adjustment, among other comments of my appearance. She not only commented on my teeth but also commented on the structure of my jaw, and bone structure. She was then trying to convince me to get a whole mouth full of veneers, rather than just fixing the single tooth (which if you know about the expenses of veneers, you could imagine the financial difference). Luckily I’m a very confident women, and immediately saw this as a sleazy sales pitch, but my heart went out to those who would have fallen victim to this manipulation. When I asked her if I could get Invisalign or a retainer to fix the problem in my bite, preventing me from taking my tooth structure off, she told me no and that the only thing that could fix this would be braces for a year. I left this facility and went to get a second opinion. At this second doctors office I was given astronomically different advice. This new doctor approached me with compassion and kindness. She told me I had a beautiful smile and that I was a beautiful young women. She advised me to get Invisalign to solve the problem of my bite because she didn’t want to take off anything from my teeth, as they’re very healthy. I’ve just begun the Invisalign process which will take a little longer than 6 months (not a year). All of this is to say, I do not recommend this facility.
