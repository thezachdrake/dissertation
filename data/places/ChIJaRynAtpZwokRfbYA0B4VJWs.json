Absolutely fantastic. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because we waited over an hour for our food. I love seeing vegan restaurants and want to promote the good ones but I just cannot get over how long the wait was. It was not crazy busy, there were only 2 of us, we didn't order anything complex, and two tables near us who came in after us were served well before us. It may have been a situation where the kitchen misplaced the ticket, but there was very little communication so I don't actually know what happened. The unnecessary wait and uncertainty put a damper on the whole experience. Once the food came, however, everything was phenomenal. As other reviewers have mentioned, you cannot even tell that the food is vegan. The flavors are rich and the texture is impeccable. The atmosphere was very nice; think hip and scaled-back Cipriani vibes. I will probably go back for the food but I would think twice about bringing new people in case we have another service issue."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The food is delicious.
