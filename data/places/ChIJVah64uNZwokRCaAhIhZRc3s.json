We arrived 4pm. We were greeted and seated immediately. That's a plus.. We say down and ordered regular drinks no alcohol. Fresh lemonade is always the way to win me over. Next we ordered some apps. *THE MENU IS VERY LIMITED* keep that in mind.  We got 2  Alcapurrias and 1 Chicharron De Pollo. The chicken was super delicious. Fried and seasoned too perfection. The Mayo ketchup sent me over the edge! I could drink it🤣 pero those Alcapurrias...... No! 👎🏾 they were super burnt and you couldn't taste the meat because of the burnt flavor. Next the main dishes.  My niece ordered the C&B Empanadas (they have diff options) with a side of white rice, I had the Pollo guisado(stewed chicken) with arroz con gandules and maduros, my bestie had Churasco with white rice. 🤦🏾‍♀️ I wanted to love this place so bad because I've been watching them since last year on IG. My chicken was definitely not fresh at all. I hate to say it tasted like yesterday left overs. Lacking salt big time. It was very bland. It could have been good if it had that and not old.  My rice was really good. And I loved the Maduros. My niece didn't like her food at all. As for my bestie idk. She just packed it up and didn't say a word. I felt bad since I suggested to come here. The server was sweet and very polite. I think I'm gonna go back after 7. This way they won't give me the pot from the day before when they first open. I hope it's good my next time around. I really liked the decor. Please don't let me down again"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Made a lunch  reservation for my birthday that my bestie wanted to take to.
