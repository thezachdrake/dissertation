He looked baffled and mystified and concluded to me that it was not the crystals in my shoulder joint causing me all the pain I was in.  When asked what else they could be, he said he did not know and wrote me a script to physical therapy and that was it.  I sat across from him and his intern in disbelief and acute pain.  I started to cry from the pain and frustration and he just stared at me.  No words of comfort or hope.  I was in shock.  I left there upset and disgusted.   I informed my referring Dr about this diagnosis and he himself knew that PT was not the answer.  He helped me find someone close to my home at this point in Stony Brook LI.   This new referred Dr.  Took one look at my MRI and texted my arms motion and level of pain and said it was clear as day that I needed these crystals as by a Radiologist. He referred me to two places and I was seen that week.
