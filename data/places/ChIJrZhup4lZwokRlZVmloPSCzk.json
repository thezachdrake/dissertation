But I’ll try. We originally reached out to Polka Dot after our venue (Gather Greene in upstate New York) recommended them, and we knew they had worked on a wedding that was essentially my benchmark for what I wanted for our own big event. We spoke to many, many planners, but eventually settled on Polka Dot because, a) as my sister the producer says, *always* go with the reference and their style seemed very aligned with what we were going for, and b) our initial conversation with Allie and Mandy gave us great confidence in how on top of things they would be. And they delivered the absolute 350% perfect wedding weekend. Since our primary planner Mandy was on maternity leave for much of the early stages of planning, we got to work with several members of the Polka Dot team. Early on, Allie was there at the drop of a hat, willing to get on the phone pretty much any time of day to talk me off the ledge regarding picking this vendor or that, and help us through the often murky waters of balancing quality and budget. When it came to designing the aesthetics, Tracey couldn’t have nailed more perfectly the natural, but elevated, vision we had. Every. Little. Detail. Was perfect—even down to the table numbers which Tracey and her husband hand crafted themselves by spray painting home address numbers and affixing them to wooden blocks to create the coolest, prettiest little details. And when my hair trial went horribly awry relatively last minute (we had to book hair/makeup folks sight unseen because vendors for 2022 were booking fast and we lived across the country in California and couldn’t travel during the early days of the pandemic) Tracey didn’t miss a beat in finding an alternative option, negotiating us out of our original contract, and alleviating all the anxiety I had about switching gears last minute. (I LOVED my new hair guru.) And then the weekend came. The weekend we had worked so hard to create, and we could NOT have been in better hands with Mandy and her assistants. My sister is a producer and often says that her job goes unappreciated because if you do it well, no one notices how much work you put into everything going perfectly smoothly. Well I’m here to say if you do it *exceptionally* well, not does everything go smoothly, but people also notice what a fantastic job you did pulling it all off. *Both* sets of parents couldn’t stop raving about Mandy—how prepared they felt to walk down the aisle, how they knew exactly where to go to do their speeches, how rain or shine they just knew everything would go off without a hitch. And guest after guest approached us all weekend long with essentially the same comments— “your planners are ON TOP OF IT.” I’ve heard a million times over that *something* will go wrong on your wedding day. That no matter how hard you work or prepare, there will be *something* that goes awry and you just have to let go of perfection. Well, thanks to Mandy and her team, that just wasn’t true. The whole weekend was sheer perfection. And we’re *very* particular people with *very* high standards. If anything at all went wrong, we had no clue. No one did. And though we definitely didn’t have the budget to pick the most expensive vendor in every category, we felt like Polka Dot helped us compile the VERY best team of vendors. We’ve gotten so many compliments about having the best food, drinks, music, venue, decor, even down to the *welcome bag snacks* which people couldn’t stop raving about. And honestly, biased or not, we’d have to agree.

Well I’m here to say if you do it *exceptionally* well, not does everything go smoothly, but people also notice what a fantastic job you did pulling it all off. *Both* sets of parents couldn’t stop raving about Mandy—how prepared they felt to walk down the aisle, how they knew exactly where to go to do their speeches, how rain or shine they just knew everything would go off without a hitch. And guest after guest approached us all weekend long with essentially the same comments— “your planners are ON TOP OF IT.” I’ve heard a million times over that *something* will go wrong on your wedding day. That no matter how hard you work or prepare, there will be *something* that goes awry and you just have to let go of perfection. Well, thanks to Mandy and her team, that just wasn’t true. The whole weekend was sheer perfection. And we’re *very* particular people with *very* high standards. If anything at all went wrong, we had no clue. No one did. And though we definitely didn’t have the budget to pick the most expensive vendor in every category, we felt like Polka Dot helped us compile the VERY best team of vendors. We’ve gotten so many compliments about having the best food, drinks, music, venue, decor, even down to the *welcome bag snacks* which people couldn’t stop raving about. And honestly, biased or not, we’d have to agree. It was the absolute perfect weekend, and we were so grateful to have the whole Polka Dot team behind us to pull it off."},"publishTime":"2022-08-18T19:00:19Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.72215068029149,"longitude":-74.00809251970851},"low":{"latitude":40.7194527197085,"longitude":-74.01079048029152}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":1,"hour":9,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":17,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":9,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":17,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":9,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":17,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":9,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":17,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":9,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":17,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Tuesday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Wednesday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Thursday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Friday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Saturday: Closed","Sunday: Closed"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"53 Beach St, New York"}
