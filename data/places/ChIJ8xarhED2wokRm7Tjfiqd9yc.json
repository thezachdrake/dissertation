Trinity Heights Church is great and welcomes both skeptics and Christians. As I understand it, the church assents to the Apostles and Nicene creeds, though not everyone in the church does, since a number of attendees do not identity as Christians. I've gone maybe 5-6 times since it opened a year ago. The focus of the sermons I've heard has been intriguing and has focused on how God is putting broken humanity back together again. This is unusual as a theme for sermons (the talks the main guy gives) and he does not at all use \"churchy\" or \"Christianese\" language. The pastor is a witty and intelligent guy with a great British accent who is doing his doctorate on Nietzsche and who is a Christian. The people at the church have been very friendly and welcoming. About every two months or so, when a sermon series wraps up, they will have round table discussions led by both skeptics and Christians to talk about what the series covered. They even served mimosas at that discussion, which was surprising because churches are often hesitant to serve any alcohol (even with communion), so it felt very \"New York\" and very approachable for anyone who was new to a church environment. They sang songs like most churches do. All in all, it was a great experience and I plan to visit again soon."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was surprised to find this church on Google Maps since they are in another building and do not own the property.
