Due to global supply chain constraints and backlogs at US Customs, I did not have the strap after 3 months! Shayna wanted to make things right and invited me back to the store to look at a similar gold thread that could be made in-house at the New York boutique (the original gold thread I selected is very thin and delicate. Only the craftsmen and women in France are trained to work with it). I liked the gold thread alternative and once I selected it, Shayna had her team produce the strap in only 2-3 days!\n\nI originally ordered my strap with a single-folding deployant clasp. It felt too bulky underneath the strap so Shayna was able to swap it for a standard pin buckle. The finished product looked absolutely amazing!\n\nI would strongly recommend Jean Rousseau for any watch enthusiast looking for a special strap to change the look of their timepiece. The boutique also offers a nice selection of standard lug width calfskin leather, rubber, and exotic leather skin strap options for those who want something right away without waiting for a custom strap.\n\nI am grateful for Shayna's help and guidance.
