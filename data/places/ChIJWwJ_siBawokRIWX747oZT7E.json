They just couldn't stand the possibility of my mom going elsewhere to use the monthly benefits. On top of that, they are also very rude. My grandparents are old and senile. The type of verbal abuse I hear coming out of them daily is absurd. Especially in times like these with the pandemic. We need a sense of community - not parasitic businesses out to milk us of our limited benefits to our elderly."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Pharmacies like this in Chinatown do not have a sense of community.
