They made me wait in store for 10mins before acknowledging me. So I left and called and they said they didnt have the 2 for $5.99 deal. But when I went online that deal was still going on for carryout at 943 1st ave so i placed my order online. I asked the guy why he told me that deal wasnt available when I called to place an order, he said today is thanksgiving and we dont have deals in store. I said that doesn make sense because I just ordered online and got the same deal at the same location that you said didnt exist today. He said onlinr only, so I said then you should have said that on the phone. They ended up burning my pizza as well."},"publishTime":"2016-11-24T22:15:49Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJKwxI1eNYwokRm3xaHqGXSLc/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsNDVXQW9nRRAB","rating":1,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU7rqvRwEMq4RPA7UTbiZ2VCTMwwk0GuzovwZtCp4JiywE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103226607105444427221/reviews","displayName":"King Moe"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The worst customer service.\nHe closed the line twice\nWhile I was trying to make a order for pick up I don’t want no delivery"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The worst customer service.\nHe closed the line twice\nWhile I was trying to make a order for pick up I don’t want no delivery"},"publishTime":"2023-11-26T04:03:03Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7565746302915,"longitude":-73.96426341970849},"low":{"latitude":40.75387666970851,"longitude":-73.96696138029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":10,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":1,"hour":1,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":10,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":2,"hour":1,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":10,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":3,"hour":1,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":10,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":4,"hour":1,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":10,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":5,"hour":1,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":10,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":5,"truncated":true,"hour":23,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":59}},{"open":{"day":6,"truncated":true,"hour":0,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":2,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":10,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30},"close":{"day":0,"hour":2,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 10:30 AM – 1:00 AM","Tuesday: 10:30 AM – 1:00 AM","Wednesday: 10:30 AM – 1:00 AM","Thursday: 10:30 AM – 1:00 AM","Friday: 10:30 AM – 2:00 AM","Saturday: 10:30 AM – 2:00 AM","Sunday: 10:30 AM – 1:00 AM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"943 1st Ave., New York"}
