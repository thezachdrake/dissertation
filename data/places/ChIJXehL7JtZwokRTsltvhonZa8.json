The surgery took about 5 hours and I was worried about anesthetic since I had bad experiences from previous surgeries, but this time after I woke 10-15 minutes I was back to normal, no dizziness or nausea. 3 days later the tape was removed and I could see that my incision follows the natural\ncontour of my face and won’t be visible after a couple of months. I went back to work 1 week later. Now after 6 weeks after the surgery, the incision is almost invisible, little bit of swelling is still there around my ears. Dr. Doshi is very carrying, he kept in touch and made sure I was following all the post op instructions and taking care of my incisions properly. I think I could not have chosen a better doctor for my face and neck lift. His work is extremely precise and nothing is overdone. My face looks very natural.
