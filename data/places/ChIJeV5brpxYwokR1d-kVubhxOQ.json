Not well known fact: the gym inside is the same size as the playground(when it's not under construction). Also, there is always a soccer game happening (idk how to explain the exact spot where it is, but it is basically at the back when you enter and look forward). The only thing is that even though there is a very. high fence, the ball sometimes goes over. There are plants on half of the perimeter of the playground too, it is an interesting spot.
