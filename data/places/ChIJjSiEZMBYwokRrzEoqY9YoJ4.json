from another medical appointment that ran a bit late.\n\nI had requested to have all the medical forms emailed to me so that I could fill them out in advance but the staff did not send them. So, I ended up having to fill them out in the waiting room while he took another regular patient who was scheduled after me!\n\nHe was in the room with me for less than 5 minutes and he did NOT listen to one word I said, talking over me and not paying attention to the answers I was giving to his few questions.\n\nPainful exam on the table.\nOnce again, most likely because he was rushing through my visit….\n\nHis office staff is “challenging”; maybe it’s the language barrier, maybe it’s cultural….. they are on the very frosty side  but not in a “mean attitude” way… just not engaging at all.\nThey do not smile, barely look at you and their sternness can be off putting.\n\nHis nurse (L.) was as rushed as Dr Frenkel and botched by blood retrieval. That had only ever happened to me once in the past 40+ years of my life.\nI gently told her to take her time & not rush while trying to insert a needle in my vein ( I have excellent veins, perfect for blood retrievals or IV lines, all medical practitioners joke about that) but she dismissed me by saying that she was not in a rush or rushing through her job….. while rushing to puncture my other arm to withdraw blood. Painful again.\nI tried to make basic small talk to be pleasant. No reaction whatsoever…..\n\nWill I go back to this medical practice: yes because my experience in the exam room could have been an one off and I’d hate to miss out on a good practitioner since, based on several of his other patients’ reviews, Dr Frenkel is a good doctor to them.\nI only wish I could have made the same positive statements after my very first visit."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Torn first time patient here….\nI’d like to give my visit a 4 or 5 stars, but I can not do so at this point.\n\nOn one hand, Dr Frenkel is a very nice man.\nMy first interaction with him, over the phone, was pleasant.\n\nOn the other hand: after my first visit: I have never been so rushed by a doctor.\nGranted, I was a tad late, coming from another medical appointment that ran a bit late.\n\nI had requested to have all the medical forms emailed to me so that I could fill them out in advance but the staff did not send them.
