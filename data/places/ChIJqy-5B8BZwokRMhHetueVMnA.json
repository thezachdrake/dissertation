I couldn't have asked for a better experience and Rene's work far exceeded anything I could have imagined. I'd been wanting to get a large dragon tattoo for well over 20 years but finding someone's whose work I both trust and their style of art proved to be a daunting task. I'd looked at hundreds of samples online over the years but nothing caught my eye enough to have it permanently put on my body, that is until I was referred to Rene. We initially spoke on the phone and I sent him samples of what I had in mind and he created the most beautiful designs for me to choose from. I trusted his vision so I let him choose the colors and gave feedback on what I had in mind and the end result is better than I could have ever hoped for. My experience with him and his studio was spectacular from beginning to end. The environment is wonderful, clean, professional and they work collaboratively as a team which I loved. You can't ask for a more talented group of artists. You walk in feeling like you're at a friend's home.\n\nI hope Rene and his team have many more years of flourishing business and the opportunity to showcase their incredible talent! Thank you so much for the wonderful care and attention to detail! You literally made a dream come true for me and I'm super grateful! You won't find anyone more decent, reasonable and trust worthy.\n\nListen to his suggestions because he knows what he's talking about! 1,000,000 out of 10 stars without a doubt!
