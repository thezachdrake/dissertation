What I am particularly impressed by (of many things) is the level of craftmenship and attention to detail. If something is not to your liking, it is fixed. For example, I was not happy with how the base cabinets were installed. They were in fact installed properly but I wanted something different. My project manager, Robbie Goldberg (who is simply amazing) looked at me puzzled and said, \"Are you sure?\" I was sure. It was a reasonably big job to redo the base cabinets in the way I wanted but at no point did I feel like this would be a problem. Robbie said with his usual upbeat and positive attitude, \"When you're happy, we're happy.\" He told his workers to make the changes and they did. I couldn't be more thrilled with my updated, spiffy new kitchen with a beautiful new floor. beautiful cabinets and a glorious paint job. I ultimately kept my vintage red countertops which was not a problem to keep and reinstall. Since you get what you pay for, My Home is not for bargain hunters. They are flexible when determining labor and materials, but you get what you pay for and for me--the second time around, I am just as happy as I was with the results now as when My Home first did work for me. Just because I know how helpful reviews are, the photos below show the excellent grout work, my steam pipe matches the walls, the beautiful bamboo floor and installation of the molding, the flawless paint job and the perfect installation of the microwave. I highly recommend My Home. They are an amazing company that operates in a way few do--with humanity, kindness and a willingness to find a solution when a problem arises. They deal with the whole customer because they know a renovation is a highly personal and stressful endeavor. Thank you My Home.
