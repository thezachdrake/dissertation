However we requested fried oyster sliders yet they brought out plain fried oysters. Once sorrected, they were the tiniest sliders I’ve ever seen. Then both of our our entrees were a disappointment. The pictures of the hanger steak but nothing like what we were served. Not only that, but I asked for my steak, medium rare and it came out medium well. The waiter who had already gotten our oyster order wrong told me that he Ordered it medium but I had asked for medium rare and insisted that that’s what I had asked for. So now the waiter and the kitchen got it wrong. When the manager came over and offered to re-cook my steak, he then asked if I’d like another glass of wine in the meantime. I thought he was offering it to me complementary for the error but he did nothing. On top of that my husbands duck was chewy. I don’t see what there was to rave about here.
