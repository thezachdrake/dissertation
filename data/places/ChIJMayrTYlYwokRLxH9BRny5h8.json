I did have to pay a fee, but we worked together on it and if you can amortize it out over your lease it becomes far more reasonable. I really do believe you get a better place with a cheaper monthly rent if you bite the bullet and pay the fee. Plus if you work with Blackwater 20% goes to a good cause.
