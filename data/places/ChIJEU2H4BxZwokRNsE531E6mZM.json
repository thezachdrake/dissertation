However, that changed once I arrived. To park my vehicle, I was told it was only valet and it was $100 per night and there was no in and out privileges. I came to find out the reason for no in and out privileges was because my vehicle was parked on the street. So, I basically paid for my vehicle to be parked on the street that was free until Monday (How awesome is that??). Next the older black woman at the front desk with the salt and pepper hair in a bun looked at me and my family like we had three heads because we were dressed comfortable versus business attire/glamorous evening wear, but I guess I shouldn't take offense because that's how she looked at another young black couple as well (I guess we didn't fit the description of the typical guests...foreign or Caucasian). There is no ice machines or vending machines, and the store closes early so if you wake up thirsty in the middle of the night...tap water is your only option. I booked a double bedroom because I had no idea it was double full-size beds. My husband booked an additional night before check out time so we could just stay in our room and then transition to the new upgraded room upon check in. I advised the front desk of the booked additional night and was still charged $75 for three hours late check out after we were advised that we had to leave our room because our current room needed to be cleaned and our new room wasn't available. (So why did I still get charged $75??!!) We had to take all of our things to the bell person who had nowhere to house our food that was in the refrigerator so that was $150 down the drain. They add an extra $30 to your room and say it's a credit for food and beverage but you lose it by 11am the next day. Also, every entree is nearly $30 so if you have a family this deal is a no go.
