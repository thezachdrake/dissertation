When we talk to other residents, they all tell me they hate Glenwood too, but they don't move because moving is such a hassle, and they don't write reviews because they fear retaliation from Glenwood.\n\nLast week a pipe burst and flooded about 15 apartments in the building. My neighbor saw the pipe and said that it looked about 60 years old, all rusted and clearly needed to be replaced decades ago. Because of the flood, a lot of our clothing, furniture, rugs, etc. were destroyed. Glenwood will pay for none of that. The only thing they'll do is scrape and re-paint the walls that have water damage (mold be damned - they refuse to open up the walls). For the tenants that can't be in their apartment because of the flood, they put us up in a super super horrifically awful crap hotel in midtown. My whole family in about 300 square feet, with cockroaches and stale cigarette smell. No compensation, no apologies.\n\nHere's the scary part: other residents have said that floods and mold are common, since the pipes haven't been replaced - ever - and the building is from the 1950's. So, any resident should be careful to put buckets under anything that could get ruined in a flood, as precaution, because you never know when another old rusty pipe will burst.\n\nOther issues:\n- The doormen let anyone in. Anyone. Without asking. They're also very lazy so don't expect them to open the door for you more than once every 20 times you enter.\n- An apartment near us has a guy who smokes on his balcony and it disturbs everyone around him, with the smoke going right into our apartment. I mentioned it to staff and they said \"it's a smoking building\", so there's nothing we can do. Aside from wait for our kids get cancer from it.\n- Walls are super thin and you can hear people above and beside your apartment, talking.\n- The hallways smell disgustingly strongly when anyone cooks. And not the good smells, I'm talking about that awful burnt grease smell.\n- Management says they'll do stuff and doesn't.\n- The buildings and management are understaffed and staff they have are lazy and careless.\n- The building's garage has already put at least 12 dents and scratches on our van.\n- The elevators were, by law, supposed to get replaced over a decade ago (according to our neighbor, who's lived here for 30 years), but they were just repaired instead, and so they're out of order several times per week.\n- The package room has lost several of our packages, and management says they'll follow up but never does.\n- There's mold in our bathroom, and they replaced our moldy cabinet, but the mold just came back because all the pipes are old and leaky.\n- There are other infestations in the building, like tiny bugs (I'm not sure what they're called, but they have lots of legs).\n- My neighbors say (I can't personally attest to this one yet since I've only been here for 3 months), that they jack the rent up as much as possible every year, and hide what new apartments are renting for (ie. you can't see the floor and size and price online)."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My family and I moved into the Pavillion about 3 months ago, and we've had non-stop problems. with Glenwood.
