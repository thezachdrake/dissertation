My friend and I, both recent music school graduates, wanted to purchase tickets for an afternoon performance. Being young musicians, we don't have the funds to splurge on $150 orchestra seats, and it was suggested to us by the box office representative to purchase standing room tickets, which she told us were $35 each (still a ridiculous price for tickets that don't even get you a seat). After my friend paid, she informs us that the tickets were actually $45, not $35 as she had told us before the transaction. She asked if that was okay, and we reluctantly replied that it was, since we had already paid and felt we didn't have a choice. Moments later, coming to the full realization that it was absolutely not worth $90-- $20 more than we were told we'd be paying-- to stand in the back of the hall for two hours, we returned and asked for a refund. The representative and her colleague next to her were extremely rude and denied us the refund, calling us foolish for \"not asking for the ticket price,\" even though it was told to us incorrectly. By asking us if the $45 was okay immediately after the transaction, I assume a refund would've been offered at that time. However, just 5 minutes later we were reprimanded, talked down to, and called names just for asking for the money back. Luckily, another very kind and understanding gentleman behind the desk-- who I assume was their supervisor-- told the woman to give us the refund. As she was processing the return, her and the woman next to her (who was not even involved in the transaction, so I'm not sure why she was even talking), continued to childishly push back at us and essentially call us stupid. I had even asked them to please stop speaking to us so rudely, and they continued. I work in customer service myself and would not even imagine speaking to a customer in that way. We are two young musicians just trying to enjoy classical music, and we were treated horribly by two immature women at least twice our age. I can't help but wonder if we would have been treated differently if we were of the older demographic that primarily enjoys performances at the Phil.
