Clean floors. This place is older- we were on the 10th floor and it looks cruddy- dirty walls, old carpet, and peeling wallpaper. BUT NO ODORS, NO BUGS. This place is like staying at an old relatives place. The bed was nice enough for 1-2 nights for sure. Our shower was NOT great, but not decidedly the worst I have had. I slept well and was able to shower. The fact that there was no odor and the sheets and towels were sparkling white and felt fresh, tells me they have excellent staff who make do with very old material. The front desk staff was very courteous and I really enjoyed the evening front desk clerk who checked us in. I would likely consider this for a single night use again. Value with a great location.
