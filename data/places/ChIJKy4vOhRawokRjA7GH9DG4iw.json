We remembered it was a dessert place and the fact that it had INSOMNIA in its name kind of told us it would be open late.\n\nWe were happy to have found the place as we weaved in and out of the streets near Fraunces Tavern.  As we went inside, we were amazed to see that this was a literal hole-in-the-wall establishment that couldn't hold many people inside.  It consisted of a counter with a menu above it and a freezer behind it that held the different flavors of Ice Cream.\n\nThe African-American guy behind the counter (and I mention race to give due credit) was tremendously friendly. He greeted us with a smile, gave us the list of Ice Cream flavors, and even invited us to take a look in the freezer for ourselves.   He really brightened up the ordering process and made us feel happy to be there.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the 2-scoop Ice Cream on a brownie.  It came to under $20 for both orders (which is a bit pricey) and as someone who demands a lot of ice cream, I was amazed how filled up I was afterward.\n\nWhat is also really great is that this dessert is served on a plate and put in a cardboard box so that we were able to easily walk across the street with it and sit at one of the benches and enjoy our Ice Cream.\n\nThis was such an incredible find for late-night Ice Cream that we vowed to return upon our next visit to lower Manhattan.\n\nBravo everyone!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Wow!\n\nSo, my girlfriend and I were staying in lower Manhattan, and late one Monday evening while we were walking around, we began searching for a place to get a sweet dessert.\n\nWe remembered the previous day we passed by this strange-looking shop with a purple sign on its outside advertising INSOMNIA something or another.

He greeted us with a smile, gave us the list of Ice Cream flavors, and even invited us to take a look in the freezer for ourselves.   He really brightened up the ordering process and made us feel happy to be there.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the 2-scoop Ice Cream on a brownie.  It came to under $20 for both orders (which is a bit pricey) and as someone who demands a lot of ice cream, I was amazed how filled up I was afterward.\n\nWhat is also really great is that this dessert is served on a plate and put in a cardboard box so that we were able to easily walk across the street with it and sit at one of the benches and enjoy our Ice Cream.\n\nThis was such an incredible find for late-night Ice Cream that we vowed to return upon our next visit to lower Manhattan.\n\nBravo everyone!"},"publishTime":"2023-08-23T19:16:31Z"}],"servesDessert":true,"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.705131880291496,"longitude":-74.0091142197085},"low":{"latitude":40.7024339197085,"longitude":-74.0118121802915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":12,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":1,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":11,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":1,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":11,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":1,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":11,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":1,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":11,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":3,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":11,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"truncated":true,"hour":23,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":59}},{"open":{"day":6,"truncated":true,"hour":0,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":3,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":12,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":3,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 11:00 AM – 1:00 AM","Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 1:00 AM","Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 1:00 AM","Thursday: 11:00 AM – 3:00 AM","Friday: 11:00 AM – 3:00 AM","Saturday: 12:00 PM – 3:00 AM","Sunday: 12:00 PM – 1:00 AM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"76 Pearl St, New York"}
