It’s setup in the back and definitely had potential. I’m going to break this review into 2 parts, before the incident and after.\n\nBefore: The meal was intriguing. The flavor profile had more vinegar than I had expected and I think it would have been nice to choose the amount of sauce we put on instead of them just pouring the amounts they did. Some dishes felt as if it drowned in sauce (like the seaweed) and if they had just pulled back, it could have been great. The “Kamayan” part was only half true since a majority of the meal was not eaten on the banana leaf table, but on small plates they brought which made it feel gimmicky. It had potential to be good if they had just left it on the table instead of bringing them on individual plates. The service and the stories from the staff was great though. The meal felt like it needed a reprieve from the intense flavors that we were getting. Overall I think it really had potential, but needs a lot of fine tuning.\n\nAfter: the tasting is done in the back section of the restaurants which you need to go up 2 steps that blend into the floor and very difficult to see. I even saw a staff trip on it lightly during our meal. My 60+ year old mother missed the step going to the restroom and fell to the floor and we ended the meal there. Though they tried to help, we were still given the bill to leave gratuity which felt extremely rude in the moment. I didn’t have the energy to argue and prioritize getting my mother the medical attention she needed, but I getting the bill in those final moments left a disgusting taste in my mouth.\n\nPut some caution tape on those steps for your own sake if not for customer safety."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I went with my family to do their tasting Kamayan menu.
