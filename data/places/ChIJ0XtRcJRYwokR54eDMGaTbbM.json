My primary doctor gave me two options: he could use a needle to drain it, or I could consult a hand and wrist specialist. I chose to see a specialist, and he referred me to Dr. Lenzo. The fact that they were able to schedule an appointment for the same day should have raised some concerns right away.\n\nUpon arriving at Dr. Lenzo's office, they immediately asked for payment for an X-ray and my co-payment. I explained that I didn't need an X-ray because the cyst was visibly protruding from my skin, and my primary doctor had indicated it was an easy fix. However, they insisted that Dr. Lenzo's policy required an X-ray before he would see anyone. This was another red flag.\n\nAfter the X-ray was taken, Dr. Lenzo did not discuss the results with me as most doctors typically do. Instead, he suggested using hydrocortisone to treat the cyst rather than the standard procedure of draining it with a needle. It later came to my attention, through my insurance company, that this choice was likely motivated by financial gain, as there is more money to be made from administering hydrocortisone.\n\nDr. Lenzo assured me that the cyst would dissipate within a week and that I should be fine. Before leaving, I requested a copy of the X-rays to add to my medical records. However, Dr. Lenzo office uses an outdated system that doesn't produce digital copies like other doctors in the city. They gave me small 5 by 5-inch pictures of the X-rays.\n\nLater that day, I intended to scan the X-rays and upload them to my medical app at Langone. It was then that I realized Dr. Lenzo had provided me with two identical copies of the same X-ray instead of all three, further adding to my frustration. So instead of the full set of three that were taken, he gave me 2 of the same and did not check to make sure he was giving his patient the right info which was frustrating and felt like a waste of time and money.\n\nSubsequently, I tried contacting Dr. Lenzo team to address these issues, but they either seemed uninformed about what had transpired or chose to feign ignorance. They told me the $89 I paid for the X-RAY had nothing to do with the X-RAY.  If feels like they are making it up as you go along.  The receptionist told me it would be an additional $5 per X-RAY. I asked to speak to the office Manager and I was on hold for over 20 minutes before I finally hung up.  It became evident that Dr. Lenzo may be approaching retirement age and could be prioritizing maximizing profits at the expense of his patients' well-being. Unfortunately, after three weeks, the pain and the size of the cyst have not improved."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I developed a ganglion cyst on my wrist due to weightlifting.
