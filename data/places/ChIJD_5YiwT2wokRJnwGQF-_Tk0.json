He sent videos and worksheets which he used to gather information to tailor the sessions specifically to me and my needs. Throughout the engagement, Marco checked in with me to see how I was feeling about progress, and adjusted his approach based on goals and what was happening in my life. He is a total professional and EXCELLENT at his work! The sessions themselves were truly amazing! AND - it worked! I saw immediate and dramatic progress in all areas I worked in with Marco. The hypnotic sessions were relaxing and I even noticed that my resting heart rate tracked on iFit went down dramatically after our first session and remained down from there. I did the homework sessions assigned and found the tailored worksheets and videos helpful. I always looked forward to my sessions with Marco and I am now a true believer in hypnosis.
