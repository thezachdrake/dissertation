I have been on this boat several times, all times were amazing and usual just me and a freind or 2. Enough that I am recognized by some of the crew (which are all amazing to a point that I try to tip all that I interact with. I have a hotel management background and recognize good customer service. Marriott and Hilton are big on recognizing repeat guests...the staff here win for this). As a celebration to end the summer, labor day weekend I decided to bring out some of parent friends as a last lap before back to school. It was group of 10 of us.\n\nI tried to buy all ten online and could not purchase. Now remeber my customer service point..Alex, who from my first trip has always been friendly, accommodating, and high energy since my first trip. After my 3rd trip in conversation on one of his rounds checking on my smaller group my plans to bring all came up. He gave me his direct number (nothing unusual in the food and beverage entertainment business to me) and said to give him a call when I planned to do it and would be sure to arrange a space that we could sit together. We'll the number came in handy double time because we couldn't get tickets. He was actually shocked as he sisnt think the count was that high..at least when I called. He told me to come down and would most likely be able to get my party onboard, we could just \"pay at the boat\". Stood in line like everyone else like normal and things turned weird real quick.\n\nI got the vibe that someone was being accused of something underhanded which was far from the case and was quite embarrassed in front of all my professional friends of which not one makes less than 6 figures.\n\nAt the end after I walked up on the back end of a little management huddle and got an earful of the story..I interrupted and asked and offered an explanation and was told by a woman who appeared to be running things that I could wait until near boarding and if space was available we could board.\n\nWell we waited..and with all the attention on us we were allowed to board. This is after EXTRA emphasis was expressed that I could board but I have to go to the window. Again  not sure what scrutiny I was under but  not a problem because I believe that is what the original plan was lol.\n\nOn to the positive! The boat is amazing. I've done brunch, I've done the sunset cruise twice and this was my third time. This hands down was my best time. Maybe because I had some of my closest friends with me. The food...AMAZING! We all had different tacos and Quesidias. The steak for both were off the charts. The sweet plantains were perfect. We had to drive back to Ct so we didn't go crazy on drinks. Had a little warm up before our food came one another up on the deck. Joan (sorry if I spelled his name wrong) fantastic and attentive. Food was out fast.  Up top, Rnee was a service with a smile bartender with great personality. Lots of space...and of course we got lots of amazing pictures🔥🔥🔥.\n\nIf you don't like huge crowds, and want a nice dining experience in a fun ambiance..you have to try this boat.\n\nAt the end I think Alex was as embarrassed as I was but I hold nothing against him. Just sounds like the organization needs to understand the top players.\n\nHe couldn't apologize enough which is much more than I received outside the accusative vibe I got outside. Dinner and we'll deserved tips to the staff plus tickets we easily spent over 600.00 but it money well spent as two weeks later my friends are still talking about it.\n\nKeep up the good work crew..I promise I'll be back and now you have won my friends over too. However, and this is to anyone looking to purchase online..if you can't just don't go..keep your money in your pocket. It gets complicated..and it does quickly.\n\nI only took a star away for this process.
