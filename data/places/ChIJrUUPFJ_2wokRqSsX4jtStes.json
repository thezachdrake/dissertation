When you bring this to the attention of the MD, he is very defensive and says you are lying.

I wish my father would not have been so stubborn and went to a clinic, nowadays any tests or blood work, patient and family can have access to. When my father attended this doctor, he would not know any result until weeks and sometimes a month later. MD follow up is poor in this medical office.
