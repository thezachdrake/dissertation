Don’t get me wrong, I liked living in the building but there were more cons than pros to living here. Firstly, the utility bill was utterly atrocious. It was around $600 a month. I have never ever paid so much in my life. In my last apartment it was at most $50. Secondly, the elevators were horrible. Not only did they take an eternity to arrive but they stop working sometimes while you are in them. During my first week of living in this building I was in an elevator and got stuck in it with this poor lady who was having a panic attack beside me. We were in there for 30 mins before anything happened. Thirdly, the management is horrible. They will only respond fast and be nice to you before you sign but after that.. forget about it. They will never answer your calls, actively try to avoid you and when you went down to the leasing office to speak to them they would say they were “too busy” to speak to you and to call them or email them instead. They are insanely RUDE. I can not stress this enough. They called my roommates and I multiple times accusing us of not paying rent when you can look in the system and see that we have in fact paid every month. Additionally, they were listing our apartment for 2K less than what we were paying so we asked for a price match and not only did they say NO, they signed away our apartment at that rate leaving us no choice but to leave. It’s also been over a month since we have moved out and we still haven’t gotten our security deposit back. This management does not care about keeping their existing tenants, I have never seen a turnover rate so high for a building. They will reel you in with the reasonable rent for one year and then double it the following year. If you are looking for somewhere to live for one year this is a good choice, if you are looking long term I advise you to look elsewhere."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am never one to write bad reviews but this one is absolutely justified.
