I intended to prepare my coffee before sleeping, as I prefer to drink it cold in the morning. Upon calling room service, a man was sent to my room to address the issue. His initial reaction was to comment on the music playing in my room, asking about my origin, which I found odd but not alarming at the moment.\nHowever, the situation took a distressing turn when, after fixing the coffee maker and while waiting to ensure it worked correctly, he inquired if I was staying alone. Following this, he made a completely inappropriate proposition, asking if I wanted to sleep together. This question was both shocking and frightening, coming from a hotel staff member. I hurriedly assured him the coffee maker was fine and asked him to leave, which he did.\n\nShaken by the encounter, I immediately reported the incident to room service.

Seeking some form of reassurance or action, I called back 10 minutes later only to be informed that the staff member had dismissed the claim, with an excuse that he couldn't speak English well. This response was frustrating and alarming, considering his earlier ability to communicate clearly enough to make such a direct proposition.\nThe incident left me unable to sleep for hours, filled with stress and fear.
