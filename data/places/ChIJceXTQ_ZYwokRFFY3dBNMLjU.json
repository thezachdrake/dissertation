We took 3 bikes and one of them broke at the opposite side of Central Park, the rear wheel could not turn so it was impossible to walk next to the bike, we had to carry it to move. We called the urgence number on the ticket 5 times but no answer. I decided to get back to the rental to ask for help. The guy working went to see my friend with the broken bike but came back 5min later saying that it was too late and that he finished working 2 minutes ago. No one was working there after, they didn’t offer us any solution and refused to give my ID back. They asked us to pay for a taxi to bring THEIR defective bike back and would not give me my ID otherwise (this is blackmail) whereas they should have gone get the bike AND my friend back!\nI never got my ID back, DO NOT go there, they just want to steal tourists money and won’t help at all of you have an issue. Otherwise if you want to ruin one of your days/nights in NY, that’s the place."},"publishTime":"2021-08-02T14:31:59Z"},{"name":"places/ChIJceXTQ_ZYwokRFFY3dBNMLjU/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVcnJyQ0dnEAE","rating":1,"authorAttribution":{"photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVl74lXPZxau-4PwxSZr0Liwg8VOzlIDqpkbsfYF1nlE8Y=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106308796102815878265/reviews","displayName":"Preeti Patel"},"originalText":{"languageCode":"en","text":"WARNING this is a rip off business don't waste your time and money on them!
