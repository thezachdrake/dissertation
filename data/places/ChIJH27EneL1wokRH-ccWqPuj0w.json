For 2 years i couldn't do any follow up\"s due to no insurance coverage because NGH file for bankruptcy and i was out of work, I'm currently in workers comp but they don\"t pay for health insurance and pay nothing compare to a 9 to 5 job with health insurance. As i walked in and ask for her i gave the gentleman my name and ask if i could talk to Dr. moss, he mention that shes with a patient.\n\nI sat down and waited 8 min and went back to the Germain and ask him that i wanna see if she could take my blood pressure which takes 2 min out of her time because i did not feel well and felt it was high blood pressure because i was weak, dizzy and with a hedic. He reply and said she can't do that because i need to get seen and enter into a room for a full check up. I asked him if he could go and ask her if is possible and for him to give her my full name which she know me and my family very well. I figure it wouldn't be a big deal. oh boy, i was i wrong!!! I heard her clearly say \"she can't do that and that i need to go to metropolitan because it's been too long\"  now i understand she wants to get pay but for an old co-worker and knowing my family not to mention i had offer her to stripe and wax her office floors for nothing in return was kinda shocking to me.\n\nShe didn't even come her self to just say hi and make me understand that she can't do such thing. I would've appreciate that more then just brushing me away like that. I'm from the neighborhood in fact i live right down the street from her medical office and when i felt the way i did i figure i could run in there for a 2 min help but no help was given. I left her office and seen a Friend of mine and he stopped me to talk so i was telling him my experience that just happen and he told me that he used to go there but he stopped because she was rude, Know i cant agree with him because i never seen that part of her but thinking about what just happen today i have to agree.\n\nAnyways, he told me to go to rite aid on 118 street on 3rd ave because they have a free blood pressure machine. Wow, \"free\" and to say i never enter rite aid to purchase anything before i felt like I'm using them mind you Dr.moss was my doctor and was getting paid from my insurance at the time. What ever happen to taking care of the neighborhood when in need? She knows i live in the poor ghetto and she knows that people around here don't have coverage but she's smart to open a medical office around this neighborhood due to cheap rent and tax exempt. I will be seeking another doctor and i was right, i had high blood pressure 163 over 88.
