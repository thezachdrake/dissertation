You can give what you stolen from me to your family and close friends because that's the only ones that eat good at this restaurant not the customers. $18.00 for a half of chicken and rice in beans is very expensive. For you to steal the breast and give people the chicken back is robbery,  disgusting ,and an insult to our community. You would not serve that below 96st so why do you serve it in our community. There are many other Latin restaurants in Washington heights. Now the customers can choose wisely. They cannot say they have not been warned.
