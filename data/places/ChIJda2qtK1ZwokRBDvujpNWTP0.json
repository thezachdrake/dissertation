Think more like back in the mid century where people would go to the dressmakers and see different designs and have them made. This is modern version of that. The brand has a huge size range and is truly inclusive unlike most brands out there that are really only for straight sizes. In trying on the clothes you can tell this is not \"fast\" clothing. The quality is exceptionally good for the price point. Jeans in the 120 range (one plus size store I shop at jeans are 80 to 90) so are not much more. Good fabrics like linen and cupro. Nice styles too from casual to more work minded.
