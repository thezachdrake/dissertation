When I got back to work and tried to do it myself, it all went down hill.

I returned at 5:30pm, the manager David was there and helped me literally until after the store closed. He had a family and home to go to in the pouring rain, but was so committed to making sure that as a customer I was satisfied and happy with my update that he stayed until almost 9pm assisting and reassuring me. I ended up returning the replacement phone and actually buying a brand new iPhone XS Max. I couldn’t be happier. He even sat on the phone with the other representative from Verizon corporate while we were figuring out totals for everything since the statement came out way higher than anticipated, and he got it back down to what it should be and even waived some fees.\n\nI am so grateful for David’s help, kindness, and patience today. I was such a flustered mess that had no idea how to fix my phone and make it work, and with his help, (he didn’t once pressure me for buying ever, rather pointed out facts and broke down all of the content I needed to know) not forcing or lying to me at all about hidden fees.
