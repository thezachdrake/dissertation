It’s clean & everything is connected through technology so you can go to either clinic & they have your information & history on file. They call in prescriptions quickly & don’t make you feel embarrassed to ask questions. They’re patient & explain everything. Whenever I leave a message, a health care professional calls me back within 48 hours (from a private number so you have to remember that & not decline the call!). On the whole, I highly recommend this clinic, particularly the nurse practitioners Evelyn & Amanda. But everyone is nice & professional.
