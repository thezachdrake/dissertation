A social worker (and my mother, who drove down from Richmond) were finally able get me out of the hospital. I can't believe this person is allowed to practice psychiatry. It was the most chaotic experience I've ever had. Having worked as a mental health technician in a psychiatric hospital before, I was shocked at how Carilion handled this situation. It has been 7 years and I still think about this woman and how grossly negligent she was. I can only hope she hasn't done this to a number of other people as well who certainly didn't need it.
