We called the “emergency number” four times when we arrived and got a call back 12 hours later. Apparently not having a bed isn’t an emergency. In that call, we were told it would be the next day before someone could come clean the apartment and bring a new mattress cover (because taskrabbit doesn’t exist in NYC?). All we wanted was a new mattress cover. Finally after 2 nights spending more that $200 a night to sleep on an uncomfortable pullout bed with 1 inch peace of foam which gave my girlfriend possible before bugs or at the very least a red, painful rash, the cleaning lady came (an hour late). We left the apartment because the Global Luxury said we needed to for covid, and when we came back there was an inch of toilet water on the floor ruining our clothes and soaking through the box we have a gaming computer in. We saw a huge pile of someone else’s poop on the floor. And in the process of fixing the toilet there is poop all over the walls and floor of the bathroom and it’s been tracked all through the apartment. (Not that it’s the building maintenance crew fault; they were amazing and helped us out immensely). We still have water on the floor and now there’s a gross rug rolled up in our unusable bathtub. The comforter is completely soaked, so now we don’t have a bed to sleep in and the bathroom needs to be sanitized before we can use it. WE DON’T HAVE A CLEAN BATHROOM OR BED AND THEY ARE MAKING US PAY FOR IT AND DOING NOTHING!!! Not only have they never apologized for any of this, but they won’t connect us to a manager. Basically this is a sh-t company that doesn’t care if you place is at all livable. This IS a beautiful building and apartment, and I highly recommend leasing it out through any other company than them or their sister company Churchill. And to make it all worse, my girlfriend is here to work an ICU covid nurse. She’s here to help people and we can’t get any. I want her to have a clean, safe place to come home to after all the hard work she does.
