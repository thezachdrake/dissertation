I met with him back in July of 2016 and from then I followed all instructions to insure insurance would cover my surgery, as to be clear this was not cosmetic.\n\nAfter 6 months of physical therapy and doctor appointments I was 100% approved by insurance meaning they covered my entire surgery. I did not have to pay anything out of pocket. This was with the help and guidance of Kerri Ann.\n\nAfter being approved by insurance, I met with Dr. Abramson to take a look at me one last time prior to surgery where he explained everything and answered every question my mom and I had. He never rushed me!!\n\nThe week before I was supposed to have surgery I had a terrible chest cold which worried me and thought about postponing the surgery. When I called the office I spoke to Zoe and explained the situation. She told me that Dr. Abramson would call me back - which he did within seconds. He explained to me that I was worried and anxious understandably and they don't cancel this surgery for a cold and to just calm down and everything would be okay - let's just say I went through with it that Friday as scheduled.\n\nWhen we arrived to the hospital and I was settled in he came by explained everything again and made sure that I was calm. He also kept my parents very well informed while I was in surgery.\n\nAfter being home for a week recovering, unfortunately my right breast started to leak fluid - this happened on Sunday morning. Worried, my mom and I called the emergency hotline to get in touch with Dr Abramson to see what was up. Again, within seconds he called back and let us know not worry that he would meet with us at his NYC office at 8:45  that next morning as he knew I had work but wanted to check me out. He let us know when we called him Sunday he was on a plane for a 24 hour trip to Boston with his family and the plane doors were closing but he made sure to call us back before he was in-flight. He then explained it was just fluid and everything was fine and not to worry but to keep him updated.\n\nAs I was still leaking after a week, I scheduled another appointment with Dr. A At his NYC office that upcoming Monday.  He realized a stitch had been irritating the area so he fixed it and sent me on my way which fixed the problem.\n\nI just saw him again today after a month and half of having the surgery and again he was super nice and warm as was Kerri Ann and Zoe. Although there were some moments that were of concern, Dr. A ALWAYS answered my questions and kept me calm.
