That’s a great thing these days when it comes to customer service, at least this is what I noticed living here in NYC.  My friend ordered empanada and I ordered their grilled vegetables. I had a glass of Sauvignon blanc and he a plain Casamigo soda.  U know that they used the freshest vegetables because I know they only used olive oil and some salt and pepper but the dish really tasted amazing. I actually forgot to take photos lol. I will definitely come back.
