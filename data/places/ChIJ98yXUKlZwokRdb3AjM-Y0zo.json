We attended the Sunday Drag Brunch which was loads of fun but the food and service was a bit of a disappointment. First off let's talk about that burrata waffle. It arrived at the table displayed on the plate, just like in the picture. A huge waffle topped with vin cotto, prosciutto, strawberries and a delicious burrata. The waffle itself was probably an inch thick. It was absolutely ice cold and was so dry you would have thought you were eating styrofoam except the waffle was extremely heavy. Basically the waffle itself was unedible. Ice cold, dry, heavy and tasteless. I ended up just scraping this stuff off top and eating that and letting them take the waffle away when I was done. I've never had a waffle that big and that horrible in my life. The stuff on top was good though. My partner had the chicken Milanese, which was basically nothing more than a thinly pounded and heavily breaded chicken cutlet on a plate with a huge pile of arugula on top. Also quite dry although tender, it needed some kind of sauce or glaze or something to make the plate less dry. Drinks were extremely expensive and very small but that's okay because I sort of expect that in a place like this. However the service was quite unimpressive. The girl that was waiting on us basically just dropped our food and forgot all about us. Anytime we wanted her we had to hunt her down. The most impressive thing was The View. When you dine at Stella 34 trattoria, you are dining on the 6th floor of Macy's with a spectacular View of the city and the Empire State Building. Like all restaurants in New York these days, this one was extremely understaffed and we were forced to wait in line until 2:45 p.m. when the show and our reservation was supposed to start at 2:30 p.m.. we had been told that they would begin seating at 2:15 and I could clearly see that at 2:15 the tables were all set and could not understand why they weren't seating us. When I asked one of the attendants when we would be seated she very rudely remarked that the performers were not ready and we would not be seated until they were ready. Frankly I don't understand what that has to do with seating us and getting our drink orders at least. Nobody really expects the show to start the minute they sit down and most of the time you are seated and have ordered before the show starts anyway. It made no sense and when we were finally seated this show still hadn't started. I don't know what the problem was but I know that the girl that I asked was extremely rude and not welcoming at all. The Drag Brunch show was fun and entertaining. The food was subpar and honestly I've had better food at local diners. I understand the Staffing shortage can cause serious problems in food service but they had a chef and what he was serving was as beautiful as the pictures on the menu but as tasteless as eating a cardboard box. I had originally planned to attend another time to enjoy their dinner menu which is not so limited but after tasting what was available on the brunch menu and being so disappointed I think I'll save my money and take it elsewhere next time."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is a Hidden Gem on the sixth floor of Macy's.
