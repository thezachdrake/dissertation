I have never seen a school that understood children and their needs better than the Forest School.  My son and his classmates in kindergarten spend 70% of the week outside exploring, investigating, learning and sharing. They learn how to appreciate and respect each other and the environment. His teacher Ms.Iannuci entourages the students to ask complex questions, to be attentive observers and good neighbors to the community that they spend a lot of time exploring. Since the school has small class sizes Ms. Iannuci can spend time individualizing the work while cultivating strong teamwork between the students. Every week we get detailed reports on what my son has been working on with pictures of his different adventures. In just a few months my son has built worm homes, studied crickets, watch Red Tail Hawks in Central Park eat lunch, played in the mud, worked on his math, improved his writing and made meaningful relationships with classmates. Dr. Gail Foster should be very proud of what she has created here. This school is absolutely magical, and I am excited to hear the Forest School is planning to serve all of the elementary school grades. I am so happy that my son has started his educational journey in a place that makes him love school.
