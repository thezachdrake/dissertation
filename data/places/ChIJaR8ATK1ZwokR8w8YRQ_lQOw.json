US$46 for 2 meatballs is a bit more than I would pay. The butternuts squash at US$23 for a fairly large bowl is also too much when the rest of the menu is reasonable priced. My partner’s pasta cost less than the soup. Again my oversight in not checking. But perhaps the staff should inform guests from overseas who may be clueless.
