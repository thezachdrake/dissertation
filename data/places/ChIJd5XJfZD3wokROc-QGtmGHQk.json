I've known Josie for a few years now. When she first told me about her boutique style skincare spa, I was excited for her new venture. I’ve battled with stress/diet induced acne scars, bumps, redness, and sensitivity. I’ve used Groupon facial treatments in the past. But, sadly never saw results. Every time I went for a facial at these Groupon Spas, I felt uncomfortable and more stressed. I saved money. But, my skin issues were still there. However, since my first consultation and visit with JoGlo Spa back in April of 2018, my improvement is beyond noticeable. Josie really knows what she’s doing. She really knows how to personalize your treatment with gentle and amazing products. Her space is calming, comfortable with good vibes. I love going to see her every 6-8 weeks, I never miss our appointments! Since I’ve made Josie my official esthetician, I've taken much more care of my face and overall health. Josie works with you and gets you on the right skin regimen. Now, my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and feels smooth. She’s made a huge difference in my life. I care for myself now more than ever, and JoGlo Spa has become an essential routine for me and my overall wellness. I highly recommend her and her boutique style spa services. I have recommended friends and colleagues to her and all have loved the services at JoGlo Spa.
