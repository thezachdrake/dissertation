Anthony end up interviewing me and was nice when you meet him…but that is when you meet him because after the interview he told what experience I have I told him, he asked what hours and locations I will like to work I tell him. So he promises me a pay rate of $18-$19 from the experience I have had. He took picture of my green card which I thought was weird. After finishing the interview he told me the scheduling guy will reach out to me regarding scheduling and if they don’t to not think that is a bad thing it probably would be they’re busy. He Also said too me  too send him a text on Friday if I don’t receive a schedule so he can help me regarding scheduling. I have texted him since last Friday till this day he haven’t responded to me nor tell me what happened. If you are not going too hiring someone is good too tell them on the sport you are not what we are looking for there is nothing wrong with that at all. I don’t mind being told that because I can moved on too the next step and  at the end of the given up is not a option for me. I am born too be told no and I know that in life you wouldn’t get everything all the time. But honesty and the truth set you free and it is what keep your company going. Always be kind, honest and trustworthy that’s how the world should work. Don’t promise people when you know you are not going to do what you said. Don’t give hopes when you know you are not going to provide what you said. 🙏🙏🙏"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"They are not serious with their words.
