I live in the neighborhood but use a different pharmacy. The only reason I visited this Walgreens today (9/8/22) is to get my bivalent booster and flu shots and this store was the closest location that has the Pfizer vaccine. I’m was not impressed with the pharmacy staff OR Walgreens itself for inefficient vaccination procedures. I made my appointment online for 2:30pm. When I got there, several people were waiting for the shot. The store was almost empty and the pharmacy had no other customers. There was a Covid check-in counter with no attendant, sign-in page, or electronic sign-in device. The was a scannable upc barcode for blank forms but when I used it, their website said forms are no longer needed. About 3 feet away from this check-in counter, there were two women speaking. It seemed like they were just socializing. One was named Jessica (who seemed like the pharmacist) and the other was named Crystal. They saw me but continued their conversation. I don’t mind people being people but bit when customers are waiting. After several minutes, Crystal told me that a form is required and she would have to go find one. The two women continued there small-talk.  Finally Jessica left and Crystal reached under the counter and gave me a blank form. SHE HAD INFORMED ME EARLIER THEY DIDN’T HAVE ANY BLANK FORMS!  Crystal needs more training in customer care and honesty. Anyway, I completed the form and 30 minutes later I’m still waiting along with many others who are here for the Covid booster. Crystal called me up to the counter and told me they can give me the Covid booster but not the flu shot because my insurance didn’t cover it. As mentioned, I go to another pharmacy where my insurance card works. If Walgreens had a good system, they would have asked me to upload my insurance card the previous day when I made my appointment (like CVS does but they didn’t have the Pfizer (vaccine). Walgreens needs to upgrade their Covid procedures to better serve their customers. And Jessica, (if in fact she is the pharmacist and the more senior of the two), also needs training in customer care and how to lead by example. Bad for business. Update: I had to wait for over an hour to get my Covid booster. Jessica - who is the pharmacist - administered it. She was polite and efficient. She also said they were over-worked and understaffed. While my sentiments always favor employees over corporations, in this case both parties, Jessica and Crystal on the one hand, and Walgreens on the other - need to clean up their act."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Glad this is not my pharmacy!
