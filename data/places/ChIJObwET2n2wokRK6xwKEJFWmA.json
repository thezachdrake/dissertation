Now They are just taking all the rents and doing just the legally required bare minimum maintenance.  One Worker quit for lack of salary payments and no raise, and staff is cut short.  Hall Walls and Stairwells have not been painted in 10 years, and Stairwells are Always full of garbage, debris and cigarette butts from Tenants who are not allowed to smoke inside their units. Carpeting is full of Dog Urine, where once dogs were Not Allowed. Lobby Doors and Windows are rarely cleaned and both elevators' carpeting was removed and NEVER replaced. Now the tiles in both elevators is buckling and coming apart.  Elevator call buttons are full of snots, bugers, spit and dirty grime from undesirable Tenants. Parking Garage shrubbery and trees are overgrown and not tended anymore by a licensed landscaper, and the Garage floor is never swept or vaccumed of old fallen leaves and tree branches. When it snows in the winter, Tenants now have to shovel their own paths to exit their vehicles out of the garage, where once the Maintenance Workers had a working electric snow blower. The blower broke several winters ago and never repaired nor replaced.  Community Room has not been painted in over 10 years and the bathrooms are disgusting.  To have an event by either a Tenant and/or public community event, the renter has to either clean the urinals themselves or hire a cleaning company before their event, when previously the maintenance staff was in charge of cleaning it on a regular basis. Now the Fee/Charge has Doubled for Tenants to use the room, which now includes cleaning it Before your event AND Afterwards. The Community Room kitchen refrigerator and stove are filthy and the entire room floor is always dirty, whereby now the renter has to mop the entire room themselves.  The lobby bathroom is so disgusting I wouldn't send a dirty Homeless person in there to use it. Previous Owners did an excellent upkeep job, but Current Owner only cares about getting monies out and putting very very little monies in; it's called \"Milking The Building\".  It is very unfortunate to have been plagued by current Slob Owners. There are now over 10 Vacancies (Empty) for both low and middle income that are being \"Warehoused\" for Over 5 years, and the  Owners are not listing them on Housing Connect website. To get repairs now, you literally have to \"Chase the Owners\" on a non-reliable website, whereby in the previous Ownership, a Tenant simply had to ask the Head Maintenance Worker, who is now hired privately because the Owners do not want to pay for Union Dues. The Superintendant does Nothing here, but live RENT FREE because he has a private-off site 9 to 5 job. Tenants go for 10, 15 and sometimes 20 years without fresh paint in their units, or have to privately hire an outside painter or painting company. The Mote around the front and sides of the building are never mowed and Large Rat Holes that adorn the mote are clearly seen from street level.  The roaches in some units are way out of human living control.  The Exterminator uses water to fumigate, which calls the roaches to enter your unit from a neighboring unit which is already infested.  And worse case scenario, the property has a Hugh Water issue, which is causing the building to literally sink more and more to where some units walls are separating from the ceilings and many many balcony floors have Large cracks from doorways to railings; hence a total building collapse is inevitable as in Florida earlier this year where many Tenants DIED. The Owners lure New Tenants to move in at High Market Rents just because the Owners remodel the kitchens and bathrooms as original Tenants move out from disgust from non-repairs, while the rest of the property maintenance is skimmed on."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Once was a very clean building before the current Owners took over.
