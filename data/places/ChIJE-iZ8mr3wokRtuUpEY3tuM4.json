They actually have a live DJ playing the best hits from the 80's to 2000! The music alone is so cool, it would really make you want to stay. We asked for a table inside and we got a nice one near the bar. As for service, we had Lauren who was one of the best ever in this industry. Such great energy, gave the best recommendations and made sure we were taken care of the entire time that we were there. Thanks, Lauren!\n\nAs for the food and drinks, they had great Happy Hour menu. We normally are wine people but Lauren made us try their rum punch and it was delicious, we went for it. We also started off with wings and since I wanted buffalo and husband wanted bbq, they were able to give us the sauces on the side. Fantastic wings too btw! Now we haven't had a meal yet as we fasted prior so we both decided to try the Truffle Burger. It comes with fries but I decided to go for curly fries and my husband went for the loaded fries. When it came we were surprised that they were actually pretty good sized and generous, for $18 each. After one bite, I was converted. The patty is generous and very juicy and honestly one of the best truffle burgers I've had here, such a pleads surprise. This alone would keep us coming back!\n\nWe also finally met Ken, their manager, in person. We first knew him when we placed an order online and he called us to clarify something and took care of our order and has always been great. So nice for him to stop by and chat with us. Also thanks for that round of rum punches, really appreciate it, thanks Ken!\n\nAlso I saw that they have at least 4-5 rest rooms, all clean and I appreciate the sign that shows if one of them needed attention, to just let them know.\n\nOverall, a really fantastic resto bar and also have such a great vibe!
