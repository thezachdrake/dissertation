A few things you should take into consideration before signing the dotted line:\n\n- The first thing new management has done, is take away our nighttime doorman service (I’m assuming it’s not long before they take it away completely, as they are in the process of implementing a virtual doorman). Please take into consideration that the doorman service provides an extra level of safety (especially at night).\n\n- This building is above three restaurants. One of the restaurants had a grease fire that started in the kitchen. The fire was not contained, and traveled up the duct pipe (which is shared with our building), and onto our the roof. By the time I realized something was wrong, I peaked my head out the door, and the hallway was FILLED with smoke. I would like to make it absolutely clear that NO FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AT ALL. This was an incredibly terrifying situation for me and several other tenants. Please find photo attached for reference.\n\n- A few notes regarding the interior: The kitchen countertops are THE WORST. They are made out of concrete and will soak anything up that sits on them for more than 5 seconds (which obviously isn’t ideal, given that it’s a kitchen). The floors are old and dull and cause splinters when walking around without slippers. Also, the washer / dryer in the 1 bedroom apts is almost useless - it washes fine, but the dryer will ruin your clothes.\n\nI will say that the best thing about this building is the superintendent, Bale.
