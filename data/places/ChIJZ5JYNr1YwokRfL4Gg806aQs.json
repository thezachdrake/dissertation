I've been to Dr Weinstein office 3 times.  He was unprofessional and rude by walking out from the examining room on the 1st visit!  The doctor Weinstein walked out from the room without explaining anything and ordering the x-rays on me.  I was upset for the way I was treated.  So I asked why I was taken to the X-Ray room without explaining me anything first when I already had the x-rays done from a hospital.  Every time I see the Dr, he doesn't explain in detail and I am always rushed out from the office.  I tried to cancel my last appointment since I didn't get the epidural injection before even considering for the surgery.  The receptionist told me to keep the appointment so that the doctor would go over the result of MRI.  So I did.  The doctor didn't discuss anything about the result of MRI but talked about performing the surgery of knee.  Since he rushed me out of the room, I left the office without realizing that he didn't go over the MRI result!  So I went back to the office and asked if I can see the doctor so he can explain about MRI result.  The receptionist talked to the doctor and she told me that I can either re-schedule for another day to see him or wait until he sees ALL other patients already waiting when I was already there earlier!!!  Unbelievable!!!  It's ok to make me wait 45 minutes to an hour to see him, he can't make a time to discuss for 3 minutes?  Obviously, this doctor only cares about making money!  That was the reason for refusing to see me right away so that he can get paid for another unnecessary follow-up consultation!  If he really cared about his patients, he could have made a little time to see me for just few minutes (since he never saw me for more than 3 minutes anyway!).  So I don't recommend this doctor!
