The woman there showed her a photo of a centerpiece for the tables, which my MIL took a photo of off the lady's phone, and didn't even make them. Instead of what she asked for, she brought centerpieces that were nothing like the photo example agreed upon beforehand, and then ended up making small air filled balloon arrangements that were uneven and boring, using plastic and styrofoam bases. The setup was excessively prolonged, and it seemed the one person she brought with her didn't know what to do, so she did everything basically by herself. She was still inflating balloons when guests started to arrive, and didn't leave until almost 90 minutes after the event started. Nothing was put in writing as to what was rented and what was bought, so what my MIL assumed she got to keep, she was told it was a rented item. The tablecloths were all different sizes, so they looked awkward as a whole. Styrofoam letters that spelled out BABY looked extremely worn down, the white couch looked worn... Everything was paid for in full, and honestly, it was overpaid for what was received. She needs to hire an assistant that knows what to do, and things should have been put in writing to show what was a rented item versus a bought item...for example, an Oh Baby backdrop light was something my MIL thought she was keeping, and then the woman asked for it back, but allowed her to keep the cheap centerpiece plastic and styrofoam stands. Things like that should have no confusion. For the excessive time it took to set everything up, to the presentation of the balloons not being up to par, to not having the agreed upon centerpieces completed...it's just too much to have her keep the full amount paid. If I were in her shoes, I would issue a partial refund. It was that bad. Had she come with an assistant or two that knew what to do, maybe it would have been a better experience. Would not recommend, based off of this one time. Would highly recommend So Bomb Balloons on Instagram instead.
