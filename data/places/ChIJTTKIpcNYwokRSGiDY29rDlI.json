To get that news was devastating, to say the very least. We are in our late 50's and have so much more to do. We live in a rural area of Pennsylvania and knew we could not get the care she needed locally.\n\nWe contacted the nurse navigator at MSK and they immediately went to work. I don't believe a day had past before they were requesting the scans the local hospital had taken and ask me overnight them. The following day, they asked if we could get NY the next day for the consultation. They simply could not have gotten everything done more efficiently.\n\nI will never forget the anxiety and fear of the morning of our consultation. We sat in the park, just across the street from his office waiting for our appointment time, completely lost and emotionally spent wondering what was to come. Less than a week earlier our lives were normal and this day we are in NYC not knowing if we had many tomorrows left.. simply horrifying.\n\nCathy, his nurse, was absolutely wonderful. She is incredibly smart, knowledgeable and very thorough. She made us feel not so alone and had a very positive approach which we very much needed.\n\nDr Voss entered the room, spoke a few sentences and we immediately knew that this was exactly where she needed to be. There are not enough good things we can say about Dr Voss. He is so, so intelligent and you just know you are in capable hands. He is amazingly articulate. He talks to you in language that you comprehend.  He is compassionate and confident. He always has a plan and knows exactly what needs done without hesitation. If there were bumps along the road, they had a solution.\n\nAlso, Cathy has always been very prompt about responding to questions and concerns that come up at home via their portal.\n\nTracy and I can not say enough about the care she has received there and would beg you, not reccomend, beg you to give yourself what you deserve... the best! Go see Dr Voss!!\n\nOur entire journey with Dr Voss, Cathy, and the entire MSK team has been nothing shy of miraculous.
