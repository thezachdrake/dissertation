When looking for a salon I was intrigued initially seeing that alibi used hair care that is completely detergent free. This made me happy considering my hair is curly, temperamental and doesn’t react well to detergents, so I decided to call. I was able to get an appointment and I’m so glad I did. Initially going in I had a completely different idea as to how I wanted my hair to look, but I also did admit to needing help with what would look best on me and we decided that he could give my hair a much needed make over. All the products used smelled so nice and natural and felt extremely conditioning and lightweight on my curls. Not only did I appreciate the products used, my stylist Koby took the time to assess what was needed and consulted another stylist to make sure my hair would tone up snd turn out perfectly. When waiting for the dye to set, Koby told me I was able to go relax on the private salon patio, while I waited for a rinse, which is a rare find in New York and such a nice, comforting vibe. After washing, it was time for the hair cut; he suggested bangs, and a choppy, lots of layers cut, and I was open to any style so I let him roll with it. For my first ever set of bangs, I couldn’t be happier with the turnout. Koby really has an eye for choosing a style that not only fits your face, but your style and vibe.
