I have been trying to build a new relationship with a law firm after 2 weeks of calling, leaving voicemails (Just to get a response if my case will be taken )however no one has heard my case whatsoever and on today’s date young lady(office manager)tells me to simply find a new law office because she can’t force the attorney to call and their are thousand of them I can call 🤦🏽‍♀️ If I was told that from the start I wouldn’t continue calling that’s one. I thought I was being patient by waiting on them to respond to my voicemails and instead it backfired. Are they really busy 🙄I really hope you guys are not keeping them busy because people like this are not genuine people and have 0 customer service skills.(it goes a long way) I was wondering why they kept  changing  people and there’s no new reviews 🤔 (reviews are mainly about Kristina, she is no longer there) It’s absolutely clear now  they are not improving. They are  probably over there finishing up their pending cases. When I was given their contact information by my attorney it was in 2014.  Yes I do keep my contacts because you never know when you need it but moving forward they will be deleted,after many years of keeping them on my phone 😂.  I just wish my attorney was still here so I can tell him this LAW FIRM SUCKED 👎 I never really like writing reviews However I’m starting to understand The logic in them and when people are wrong and only when they are wrong and it effected in me in some way, I actually look forward to saving someone else from going through the same experience Plus like they said they are plenty of attorney office out there!!!so they won’t be missing out on nothing right? 🤷‍♀️ I say take your chances look elsewhere…. if I find the perfect one I might just come back and point ya in a  better direction."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I gave them a star because you must give them something.
