Not only did the pediatrics at Lenox fail to assess our son properly but Dr. Ng completely messed up our son’s circumcision according to the pediatric urologist and surgeons. Apparently, the circumcision was done so poorly that it seemed to them that someone who didn’t know what they were doing did it.\n\nThe anxiety and trauma that this whole thing caused is so miserable and makes me regret the whole decision to deliver at this hospital with this team. I don’t understand how pediatrics at Lenox gave the green light to have the circumcision.\n\nThe doctors here are great for anything gynae related, but it’s insane that any doctor but a pediatric surgeon touch your son’s genitals. So please remember that when you choose this practice.\n\nInitial post: Wonderful doctors, very supportive practice.\n\nFirst of all, I’d always see the doctors on time here, rarely ever any waiting time.\n\nAll the doctors are extremely knowledgeable, empathetic and answer all your questions.\n\nI saw Dr. DiGregorio the most during my routine visits and she was great. Super relaxed to talk to, always answered my questions, and gave off a very cool/calm vibe. She even checked on me after delivery while I was in the recovery room at the hospital. She was always prompt to respond to queries via the portal too.\n\nDr. Elliston delivered my baby, and it was such a lovely experience having her. I can’t say enough good things about her. Even during my check ups, she was extremely thorough, warm, personable, empathetic and gave as much time as we needed, never made us feel rushed. My labor was long, and she was patient, and she always gave us options and let us make the decisions. She was super empathetic and also very supportive of what we wanted. She even impressed my doula with the knowledge she had regarding positions to help with baby’s descent. Overall, it was such a pleasant experience having her.\n\nI only met Dr. Ng twice, once for a checkup and once at the hospital. She did my son’s circumcision and she did a fine job! She was extremely sweet and warm when we met her at our check up, and even when I saw her in the recovery room - she was super understanding of how I was feeling, providing whatever we needed at the time.\n\nI met Dr. DiSturco about two times and she was on call when I went into labor. When I was uncomfortable during a cervical check, she immediately stopped and told me we didn’t have to proceed. That was very encouraging to know, that she put my comfort as a priority. She was also very sweet when we spoke to her when we called once contractions started.\n\nAll the doctors at this practice were great. They deliver at Lenox, and the nurses in L & D were mostly great. The ones in the recovery room were hit or miss. It is a teaching hospital which i guess most NY hospitals are, so there were times when residents would come in during the middle of the night and ask questions that you’d wish they came during the day for. During the recovery period, that was quite annoying esp since we were lacking sleep. So the only downside to my experience was the hospital itself. I had a bad experience at the triage one night when I went before labor too. And I was told the day I’m in labor I wouldn’t have to go through the triage and would be admitted directly, that didn’t happen, and I couldn’t have my support person during the cervical check and all.

The receptionist I was spoke to was completely unpleasant, nasty, and unprofessional. I told her I wanted to cancel and no longer want to be part of their practice.
