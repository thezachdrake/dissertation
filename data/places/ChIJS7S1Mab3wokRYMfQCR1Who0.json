I pulled my phone to confirm the date, time, and place.  All were correct.  I noticed signage around the pharmacy stating the pharmacy was open until 7 pm.  I was there at 5:45 for a 6 pm appointment.  I asked a Target associate who was busy, stocking shelves why the pharmacy was closed.  He said he was sorry, but this pharmacy is NEVER open.  He was unable to provide me with details because the pharmacy section is a separate entity from Target.  CVS rents the space.  I called customer service to try to ascertain what happened.  I doubt I am the only person this has happened to.  I was told my complaint would be directed to someone more senior than the representative I spoke with.
