The rice paper chicken quesadillas, though a little thin, were savory and especially well paired with the sauce. The stars of the meal were the miso cod cakes and the lychee martinis. I could eat 10 more of the cod cakes right now. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, savory, umami, and a little sweet all over. The lychee martinis were so strong but not in a bad way.  The service was also great. Staff were so friendly and quick. Great vibes as well with a little bit of a darker atmosphere.
