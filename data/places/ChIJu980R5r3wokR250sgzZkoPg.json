They are always interested in learning something new about music. It’s not unusual for them to offer bits of showbiz history or to join with the singing.   They always welcome us when we arrive and also come up to us after the performance to chat.\n\n2) The Staff is friendly and extremely helpful.

Also, the desk receptionist and aides always greet us with a smile and everyone is happy to help with set up.\n\n3) The Environment is well suited to our music programs. The facility is neat, clean and welcoming. Putting the acoustic grand piano in the front lobby creates a true musical experience in a homey parlor-like atmosphere. There is ample seating in comfortable chairs that are placed so there is good visibility and acoustics and so that should there be any latecomers they can easily take a seat without disturbing the performers or audience.\n\nYet what we really appreciate and enjoy is\n\n4) The Attitude of everyone at VISTA. Both the Residents’ needs and Music are truly appreciated. This makes it a genuine pleasure creating monthly programs that are therapeutically effective as well as culturally interesting and entertaining.\n\nBottom line: There is a feeling of mutual respect, purpose and enjoyment.
