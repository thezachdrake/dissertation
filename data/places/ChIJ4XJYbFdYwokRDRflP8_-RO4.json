Had to follow up 2 times myself phoning them, waiting on the phone for them. After a week the nurse calls, doesn't really give me places I could go to, doesn't even tell me in detail what I need to say to whoever I go visit. She gave me a number for NYU near where I lived, and says everything is in the notes of the doctor. When I look at MyChart, there is nothing. Not even sure who to talk to.
