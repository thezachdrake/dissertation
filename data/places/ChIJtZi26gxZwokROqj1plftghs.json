Without her, I wouldn't have remembered to do that and would have missed out on that precious, precious memory. We spoke to several other photographers at different price-points. While Rachel ended up being one of the more expensive photographers, we chose her for her ability to capture candid, beautiful moments and honestly feel like she was worth every penny!
