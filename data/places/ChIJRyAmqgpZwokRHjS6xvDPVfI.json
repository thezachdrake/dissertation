Heavy though, probably better for a party of 4. The butter lettuce salad was delicious. My burger was very good but not sure I’d recommend it at $31, overpriced. Also, potato chips on top with French fries on the side is a bit of overkill. I knocked most of the chips to the side. The pork chop was very good. I had a classic Negroni, well made ($20) and my husband had an alcohol free Negroni ($15!). Guys you might want to bring that price down, it’s not a finely crafted cocktail.
