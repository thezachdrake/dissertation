I bought three different flavors of the new food she recommended, both of my cats LOVED them all. In the past, every time I’d trying switching their food they wouldn’t eat it or would vomit shortly after eating the new food. No such issues with this stuff! They can’t get enough and they keep it down. Prices are great here too, I checked with two big online retailers and the food is the same price at Pet Central.

It was the beginning of Covid and my girlfriend and I had decided to actively stop using big corporate like Amazon as much as possible. Mind you I get 30 pounds of senior Nutro kibble for $54 on Amazon. I called the store to see if they can match or even come close because I want to use them and we were trying to support small business. The woman who picked up the phone told me the best they could do would be $58 not including delivery, I agreed and told them to special order the food, they said it would be 3 to 5 days. I gave them my phone number and waited. I called five days later after not having heard from them with only one day of dog food left. The man who picked up the phone told me he had no idea what I was talking about and someone would call me back. An hour later at 3 PM a lady from the store, in fact I think the lady I placed my order with called me back. Quite unapologetically she told me she forgot to place the order. There is no way this dog food store would be getting me my food on time .Now I was in desperation mode, my dogs eat senior neutro kibble- it’s not easy to find, I took the bus to Petsmart on 90th and Broadway and they didn’t have it. It was too late for me to order from Amazon I only had one meal left. I had to call in a favor and get a buddy from Brooklyn to come pick me up in his car and take me to Westchester where we went to multiple pet food stores to finally find it. I’m so sad to report that I can no longer use this company. They completely let me down."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’ve got to tell my story.
