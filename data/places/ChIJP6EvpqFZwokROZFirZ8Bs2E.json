Michelle finds fun ways to teach note-reading, pays very close attention to what her students need, and tailors their lessons around overcoming their challenges and enhancing their strengths. She has done a marvelous job helping Kai understand dynamics and tweak his technique, continually feeds his love of music with just what he needs, and genuinely pushes him to reach his full potential on the keys. Allegria Piano’s recitals are always a treat with such intriguing, bold, and varied song choices; again a testament to how well Michelle knows her students’ abilities and styles.
