Now to be fair, Carlos (the pretty cool manager) did warn us it would be a bit of a wait. But why even sit us if we wouldn’t be served for a whole 3hrs. Still, the worst part of my experience was the chefs lack of skill. A Mexican hibachi chef whose skill was constantly banging on the table for “dramatic effect” and accidentally dropping utensils. I was very unimpressed and could not help but to think “is this guy really a chef?” They sat all 10 of us at one table that I believe was meant to fit 8ppl max. The chairs were not the correct height to match the table. So not only were we tight, but we were much lower than we should have been. The food was okay, nothing special. The drinks were tiny and full of ice and sugar. I guess they had no room for alcohol because no one at my table believe any of our drinks had an ounce of alcohol. Lastly, everything (especially the drinks) was pricier than I expected. Google has them as “two dollar-signs” but they should definitely be three, maybe they’ve raised prices, idk. I’d honestly be surprised if this place survives the winter. Never again."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Worse hibachi I ever been to.
