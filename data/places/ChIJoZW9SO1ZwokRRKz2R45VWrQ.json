Gazmend Gjeka is the current manager and my experience with him as been utterly horrible. I manage an estate sales company and had to work with Gazmend to help my client sell a limited number of furniture and appliances (1 couch, 1 bed, and several small items). During my initial phone call with Gazmend, he yelled at me continuously and falsely told me that my COI had insufficient coverage (which was NOT true). He then went on about the building's policy against moving on the weekends, but when we tried to explain that we understood he just kept talking over me and saying repeatedly \"I don't want any calls from you over the weekend!\" and how he didn't want to be \"bothered\" over the weekend. Basically, he had zero interest in listening to me and just wanted to talk AT me.  Then, on Friday (the day that those limited items were being picked up), he shows up at the apartment door and AGAIN yells about the same things (that my COI is \"incorrect\" when it is not).  He adds that he \"told\" me the other day that there is a 5pm cutoff on Fridays - he did NOT mention this to me at any prior time. (He told my client the same thing on the phone- that he had told them about the cutoff when he clearly didn't.)  In other words, he blatantly lied in order to cover his own tracks, i.e., his failure to disclose that rule beforehand.  Throughout this entire process, he has been rude, dishonest, and completely unprofessional.  Right now, with only a couple hours left until the supposed \"cutoff\" (which he changed to 3:30 pm on the spot), he still hasn't given the ok to move just a few items (even though I have MORE than sufficient coverage).  In short, I am appalled at my experience dealing with him- he clearly does not know how to speak to or interact with people, or even do the basic duties of his job. I am shocked that a building as nice as this would hire someone so crass.\n\nJust know that if you do choose to buy here and eventually sell, Gazmend will do nothing to help you."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"If you're looking for a building with a good building manager, DO NOT RENT OR BUY HERE.
