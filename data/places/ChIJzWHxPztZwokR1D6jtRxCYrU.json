The chicken is minimally greasy as well, which allowed me to eat as many as I liked without feeling sick, I even bought some more soy garlic wings to go! We tried the combo, it was super delicious, the spicy wings were actually spicy!! The truffle crispy chicken salad is my all time favorite salad! I mean look at the greens!! Super fresh and crisp. Who knew adding truffle oil to a salad could work? The chicken was extremely crispy too, usually when I order a crispy chicken salad, it’s not crispy… but not at Koko’s, their crispy chicken is ACTUALLY crispy! We loved their kimchi burrito. Instead if regular kimchi fried rice, kimchi burrito is a quick and easy alternative to munch with you hands. Especially if you’re already ripping apart your delicious wings with your hands. Their tteokboki was topped with crispy calamari. Chewy rice cakes simmered in sweet savory spicy sauce!! It’s heaven. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like this dish honestly. They also have some amazing housemade iced teas. We tried their lemon and peach, I know you’re thinking lemon iced tea is basic…. Not at Kokos!!! Their lemon iced tea is crisp and refreshing, the lemon does not taste artificial at all either. I would say it’s the best lemon iced tea we ever had. We also got the peach iced tea, it was also sweet and refreshing, honestly thinking about it rn makes me crave it more, especially in this heat. They also have boozy drinks if you wanna bring it up a notch. Soju is always fun with friends!! Stop by their location and hangout in one of their swings located in their private outdoor seating in the back, or check out their Upper West Side location!
