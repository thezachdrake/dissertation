The shower was nice and tall, my husband is 6'3 so it really does make a difference. The only thing that would of made it better would have been the towels, they were small and very rough, there was no coffee maker in the room, and when we turned on the heater it made creaking sounds but it went away after a minute. They were minor things, we still enjoyed our stay.\n\nStaff was very friendly and helpful when we arrived and gave us priority since we had a reservation. Valet was an extra charge (around $70) but you have to pay for parking anyway (around $50) and I don't think it's close so we decided to upgrade and it was great not to have to worry about our car, we planned on walking to were we needed to go and it worked out great for us.\n\nIt's a well maintained hotel, lobby is clean and spacious and was beautifully decorated, really gives you the New York vibe. There are 4 elevators so we never had long waits to get to our room. Didn't get to check out the rooftop restaurant because it was closed. Found the stairs to the pool but we have a baby and a stroller and couldn't find the elevator to take us all the way up but didn't try that hard so there might have been a button we didn't see. My only note with the rest of the hotel is that brightening it up might be more inviting, the rooms and hallways are a very dark theme that don't do the beautiful place justice in my opinion.\n\nWe would definitely stay here again, however we will upgrade for the bigger room maybe with a view because it's a great location. Has lots of restaurant options just a few feet away and target is less than half a mile for any essentials.\nWe stopped at a coffee shop right around the corner on our way to the park, you arrive close to a playground and if you keep going a little bit you find the ice rink. Times square and Rockefeller were a longer walk but worth it, lots of places to stop on the way so didn't mind the walk at all."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Perfect for our one night stay in NYC.
