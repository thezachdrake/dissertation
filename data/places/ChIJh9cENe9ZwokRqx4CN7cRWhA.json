Equally important, working with David was a pleasure throughout the project. He seeks input and guides the design process gently, working together to reach decisions. He takes full ownership of implementation, making sure that everything is made and installed as it should be. When the inevitable issues arose he quickly handled them without delay. His team of craftspeople, movers and installers were all excellent and they also took pride in their work. In conclusion, David does great work, and does it in a very professional way.
