Wedding\n\nMy real rating is 4.5 stars because of a few small mishaps, but overall I’d still round up to 5 stars.\n\nCommunicating with Chris Chen from start to finish was easy. I also liked how we had two zoom calls before the actual wedding day; I imagine if your timeline needed more work, he’d be flexible with having more than that.\n\nThe day of wedding was really great for the most part. There was a small mishap during our short impromptu Ceremony rehearsal. The DJ played the recessional song instead of the processional one. Well, at least that was during the rehearsal and not the actual ceremony! 😳 I would not have been happy.\n\nAlso I think they had set up an elaborate mic stand for my Officiant for some reason. I told my cousin to make sure he moved it before we did our kiss (didnt want it in the pictures) but I think in the end my cousin just decided to do away with the stand all together and just held the mic. This was the right call on his part.\n\nThere was another small hiccup before the real ceremony where the right music wasnt being played again, though I think that may have been because the DJ wasnt given the cue that we were actually starting. I dont know. But it’s ok, no one but me and the wedding party noticed I think. 😓 Otherwise, the ceremony ran very smoothly.\n\nI have no complaints for the music throughout the night. They played my prepared playlist and played all the right music for my grand entrance, first dance, cake cutting, grand re-entrance, and my various tosses (bouquet, cat plushie and dog plushie). My people arent really dancers, but what little guests did go on the dance floor danced their hearts out and had a great time.\n\nThe MC they had for my day did a great job overall. I think most of my guests are not used to there being an MC for a wedding, let alone one who can fluently speak Cantonese and Mandarin. I was a little bit disappointed and miffed that she told me that she was more or less going to just do Mandarin and English though. I mean, I understand that doing three languages is hard on her and even the guests, but I feel like this should have been communicated more upfront before the event. Then at least I wouldnt have just said “yes” because I was tired of making on-the-fly decisions all day 😓😓😓. Oh well. And the MC did keep asking me about things in the timeline through the evening….I dont know if that’s normal or if maybe she just wanted some input in the whole thing? I dont know but I managed. As my husband said, maybe she was just offering suggestions? But sometimes it didnt feel like that to me, I felt pushed into not keeping true to my original plan.\n\nBut I would say overall, I was happy with the MC. The MC kept my guests entertained and she did a good job keeping the event on schedule. We ran a bit behind on time but that’s to be expected really. No one but me, who remembered the schedule religiously at this point, knew lol. My husband’s family were very pleased with her work as well. Also, she was great at getting women to get on the dance floor for the bouquet toss, because for some reason everyone was super shy for that. 😂 I think by the time the cat plushie and dog plushie toss came around, the crowd was more into the idea and wholeheartedly participated.\n\nTo summarize, Dynasty Wedding did a great job for my wedding and I definitely would recommend them. There were just a few minor things that happened here and there. But that’s the nature of weddings I suppose. Learn to let some of the minor things go and just roll with the punches."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dynasty Wedding\n\nMy real rating is 4.5 stars because of a few small mishaps, but overall I’d still round up to 5 stars.\n\nCommunicating with Chris Chen from start to finish was easy.
