When we arrived we were met with an absolutely miserable bartender who could barely smile or talk and had an attitude as though she was doing us a favor by serving us.

We went in every week when he was there and go to see him where he currently working. No surprise he didn't stay there with how this place is run. It seems as though now there is a new bartender every time we go in and a revolving door of employees who clearly do not want to be there.\n\nAs a chef and someone who has worked in the industry for 35 plus years, it is extremely disappointing to have this kind of service. The food is great from Frenchman's Dough but it is hard to enjoy when the service is so bad.\n\nThe bakery downstairs now never seems to have a supply of anything we like and by mid afternoon they are completely sold out and the black and white cookies we bought last time were stale.
