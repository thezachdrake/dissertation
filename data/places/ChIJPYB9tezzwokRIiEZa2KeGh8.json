I will probably be saving a lot of students high schools lives because I don't want you to experience what I went through as a person at this school. This is not where you want to be. This school treats everyone like prisoners with their strict rules and everything. Rules are good to keep control and order but once you come here, it's on a different level and you literally can't do anything wrong or make a mistake. Learning requires a good experience and good people to be around and this school does not have that. We have 8 schools in one building so you will be spending your whole 4 years on only one floor. Trust me when I say this, you will regret coming here. High School allows a bit more freedom and this school takes all that away from you. For freshman year you have to be in the \"fish bowl or common area\" meaning a certain place on the floor which only contain a couple of rooms. You will be with the same students for 2 years like you did for kindergarten. After that, then they will split you up for junior and senior year. I am a really good student with high hopes and this school has done nothing to help me. Please don't make the same mistake as I did, I hope all of you reading this review will take this into consideration seriously and believe me. The staff are enslaved to the principal and dean who are terrible people. Go somewhere else and make sure it's a great school. Uniform is required so if you want a little bit more freedom, search for schools that don't require it. (Boys wear ties with white oxford shirts and girls have the same but no tie. It's really stupid)\nIf you don;t believe me, see it for yourself. But i'm going to warn you that once you come in for freshman year and you want to transfer to another high school because of the issues, there is a slight chance of you going into a high school of your choice. Please be careful and make the right decision. I messed up because i waited until the second round to choose my high school. I want to save many of you from coming to this prison hell hole. This school is considered the BEST only because we have 7 other TERRIBLE schools, so we seem like we are really \"GOOD.\" This high school has ruined my life and i wish i could go back in time and change what i did.
