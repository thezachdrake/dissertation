Although they have an exterminator stop by every week and they really did try their best, I was told that because 101W15 is located on top of a subway stop, that all the rats/mice/cockroaches have a straight shot up to the building. For the years I lived there, I dealt with frequent visits from water bugs (which look like massive cockroaches and are terrifying. I won't attach any photos, you get the idea) and mice/rats. It got to the point where the exterminator was visiting my apartment regularly, I had all my pantry food (cereal, bananas, sealed granola bars, rice, etc.) either crammed in the fridge or stored in ziplock bags that were then put into tupperware containers, and I didn't dare put out any water for my dog and only gave him water with his meals. Even then, new waterbugs would consistently pop up and scurry around the apartment and the mice would chew through the tupperware and leave poop droppings everywhere. I do consider myself a very clean person (to the point of being a bit OCD), so this was a very challenging experience for me and I considered breaking lease many times.\n\nI know that this was an experience that many of my fellow tenants had, but not everyone, so if you end up choosing this building, you either need to be comfortable with dealing with huge cockroaches + mice or have enough good luck where you end up in a unit that has fewer mice holes/cracks in the walls.
