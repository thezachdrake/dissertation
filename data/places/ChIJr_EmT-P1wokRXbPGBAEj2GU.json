My son was doing so well, he was able to skip a grade and being that he tested on 4th grade level math, being now in 2nd grade (instead of 1st), he has been able to attend 4th grade level classes. He truly loved his kindegarden teacher, Ms. Margaret, and now his 2nd grade teachers, Ms. Lisa and Ms. Eileen. He enjoys his chorus, music, art and science classes. The education in River East Elementary is both traditional and progressive. They offer many hand-on learning opportunities where kids utilize their knowledge, imagination and build models for communities, eco-systems or governmental bodies. We feel very fortunate to be part of this community. It's a very safe and loving environment. Have asked about the reviews below and apparently a teacher hitting someone is not even about our school so please do not get discouraged. I highly recommend joining us!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"River East Elementary, a non-zone half traditional, half progressive school, turned out to be such a gem for our 6 years old son.
