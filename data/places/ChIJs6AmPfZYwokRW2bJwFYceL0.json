The “Studio” is a small intimate setting theater seating no more than 75 people on a six-tier platform on comfortable chairs.\n\nThe play was an adaptation by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins of the original antebellum play from 1859 by Dion Boucicault.  The setting took place in Louisiana at the Terrebonne plantation owned by the recently deceased judge Peyton.\n\nDirector Dean Irby and dramaturg Dezi Tibbs undoubtedly got it made since they were supported by a very gifted company of actors -- some playing multiple roles. The stage is barren with very simple props consisting of boxes, tables and chairs. But none of this matter because once the play begins, we are totally immersed by the excellent performance by the actors. There’s a nice touch of a Br’er Rabbit (Lola Fadiran) who would peek between the curtains and sneak around in her bunny costume on the stage setting up tables and chairs. Lola Fadiran also played Grace, a “field” slave.\n\nThe play began with a monologue where BJJ (Jaucqir LaFond) recounts a conversation with BJJ's therapist. As the monologue ensues, LaFond applies white-face makeup and brings up points about portrayal of race in America but also the difficulties finding white people who are willing to play the part of the slave owners. Meanwhile a drunken Boucicault (India Derewetzky) appeared in the background struggling to be upright. Throughout the play, Derewetzky delivered a dynamite performance playing multiple roles such as the native American Wahnotee and also the auctioneer. Sometimes Derewetzky would interact with the audience by directing her stares and funny conversation to the audience pool.\n\nThe Terrebonne plantation is supposedly unravelling and in financial ruins due to debts and scarcely populated by slaves and blood relation. Peyton’s nephew George (Isaiah Brown) recently arrived from France as heir of the plantation. George who was raised as a yankee and lived in France was a challenging character since he does not embody any of the Louisiana’s demeanor. Isaiah Brown did a great job with an accent which put him outside the southern circle. George fell in love quickly with Zoe (Bethsabé Caballero) a beautiful Octoroon (one-eighth black) while Dora (Jacqueline Byrne) a neighbor did not hide her attraction to George. But George was not alone since the evil overseer M’Closky (Jaucqir LaFond) also wanted Zoe to himself. Not as noble as George’s intention --who wanted to marry her-- but simply to have Zoe as a body in bed and a hidden plan for Terrebonne.\n\nMilton Espinoza Jr. did an awesome job playing multiple characters of Assistant/Pete/Paul with his blackface. He was funny and believable in the roles. A trio of slaves Minnie (Sarah-Michele Guei), Dido (Scenarios Thurmond) and Grace (Lola Fadiran) were delightful with their funny performance throughout the play who talk and act like they live in the present day.\n\nAs the story unfolds, there’ll be a murder, a cover-up and discovery of paperwork which complicates Terrebonne financial status and leads to Zoe being auctioned. Captain Ratts (Jeffrey Parksinon) added fun to the auction when he was supposedly selected from the audience.\n\nThe stage production and support team (Production Stage Manager: Paola Solís-Ramírez, Sound/Projections Design: Ariana Swei, Fight Choreography: Jacqueline Holloway) did an excellent job with the simple style stage and props. It’s worth mentioning that Emmanuel Delgado did a superb job with the minimal lighting system. From setting the mood to a rather complex orchestration during the fire scene. All in all, an enjoyable play.\n\nWhether it’s black with white face, red face, or black face this play delivered the cultural critique in a provocative way. The play’s scorching indictment of stereotypes and slavery manages to be funny and corrosive at the same time in which no one is spared. If you felt uncomfortable, it is meant to be."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I attended the last day of the play “An Octoroon” a Production of Columbia University School of the Arts at the Schapiro Theater/Studio.
