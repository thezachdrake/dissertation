I enjoy all the frequent pictures and videos sent to me via text message. I get to see my boys happily enjoying meal time, engaging in fun activities and playing at a near by park. Not to mention even taking a safe troll on a double stroller like the one I own! The owner Wandi is transparent, easy to communicate with and reasonably felixble. I just heard their services will sometimes be available at night, so parents can schedule an occasional date night! I can't wait to take advantage of it...finding a local evening sitter for 2 is difficult. I see my children growing at Pee Wee Playhouse for the long run.
