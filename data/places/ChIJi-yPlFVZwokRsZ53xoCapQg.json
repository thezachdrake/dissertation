The seating was typical Japanese style with an L shaped counter and you can see the sushi chefs preparing the food. We tried a few of their sakes, and they were all excellent. We came for my sister-in-law’s birthday and they gave us a free glass of a very good sake to celebrate. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the sushi chefs were fantastic.
