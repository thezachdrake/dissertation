WooWoo was highly recommended to me by a neighbor as I was explaining to her about my dogs anxiety and need for a haircut. I was excited as they are just 2 blocks away and made an appointment right away.  They space is so cute and they are so warm and welcoming. I stressed to them that she's super anxious with her muzzle and paws, was black listed due to her high anxiety etc etc and they assured me they will work with her. I also explained what kind of cut I wanted , specific tail trimming etc. I was surprised how quickly they completed her groom AND they were able to check off all my requests. They saw she grew anxious when they used the electric clippers near her head so they switched to scissors and she was fine. They were even able to trim her paws AND nail grind!! I was so happy how understanding, calm and accommodating they were to our baby.  You can see how good they are with dogs as they were smoothing and caressing her muzzle showing how they worked with her and she didn't even snarl. I will definitely continue going to them and highly recommend them. Thank you for the wonderful service you showed my little girl."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The before pic is her sitting on the floor.
