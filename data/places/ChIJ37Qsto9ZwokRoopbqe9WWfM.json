Staff is very friendly, accommodating, and professional. If you're looking for a methadone clinic go here, dont waste your time anywhere else. I was medicated on the first day. They dont force you to go to groups. The counselors are very helpful and they have on site medical and mental health services.\n\nUpdate!\nToday, 7/17/23, was my last day at Greenwich House. A few months ago I had been on 210 mg of methadone for about 4 years and decided it was time to get off. So I began to taper down relatively fast dropping 10 mg per week. When I got to 20 mg I slowed down to 5 mg decreases per week. Anyway, when I got down to 5 mg I decided to go down to 2 mg and that was today. I got my weeks worth of 2 mg bottles and when they're gone I'll be totally off methadone. I did this with no withdrawal symptoms or cravings. And I have not touched dope since I began the program on 4/27/19. I'm so proud of myself and this is a total success story. There is such a stigma about methadone. People say it's like \"liquid handcuffs\" or that it controls your life and it's impossible to get off and it's just replacing one drug with another, but I'm proof that none of that is true. Methadone saved my life and when I felt I didn't need it anymore I got off, simple as that. I would like to thank my counselor Sophia and Marlene from the medical department for both always being so supportive and accommodating. They genuinely care about all of their patients and deserve mentioning although all the staff is very caring, helpful and professional. I cannot recommend this place enough if you are struggling with addiction. They WILL help you."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I've been to several methadone clinics and Greenwich House is by far the best.
