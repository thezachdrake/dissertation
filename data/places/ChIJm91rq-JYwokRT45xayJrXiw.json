And hey, you can even use the pool. The room was small, but not as small as I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it even had a writing desk and mini-fridge. The room was spotless and they even changed my towels and sheets every day. I was glad I'd booked a room with a sink, as the bathroom situation was a little weird. Not sure how it was on other floors, but on mine there were only two women's bathrooms for the whole floor. One only had two showers in it, and the other had two toilets, three open showers (without shower curtains), and one sort of \"shower closet\" behind a closet door. The two-shower bathroom was periodically locked, so I had to choose between baring it all in one of the curtain-less showers or hoping that no one peeped the window on the closet shower. I opted for the closet shower, although the setup was still weird enough that in order to actually get my towel, I had a quick brave moment of whipping open the closet door and hoping no one walked in while I exposed myself.\nSo, would this be my top choice for staying in NYC? Oh no. But would I consider staying here again? Surprisingly....yes.
