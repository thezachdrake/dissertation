The cashier, who was very nice, told me the book was $60 - honestly sounded accurate for a brand new, well made design book.  I had a hunch though that it could be overpriced and when I went to look it up online, I found the exact same book, also at mom & pop bookstores - not the big chains or Amazon, selling it for $20 less.  There is no reason to up-charge such a large margin even if your store rent is high, or your costs are a bit higher, that's a huge 33% margin.  I'm not saying that all of the books there are this way, but this one being marked up that much just rubbed me the wrong way.
