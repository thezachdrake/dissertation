She still sat on the phone with me during the roughest part of my labor to comfort me and remind me how strong I am. Once my daughter was born Carol came and collected the placenta to dry and capsule for pills. Post birth she brought me teas and oils to help my body heal. Now expecting baby number two in a few weeks, Carol is set to be there with us and has eased every concern that I’ve had and worked with me to create a birthing plan. I’ve recommended her to friends for consultations and everyone tells me how warm and helpful she is.
