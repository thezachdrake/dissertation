I got the shawerma sandwich when I ordered it the staff pulled out a bucket of meat, placed it onto the stove warmed it up and tossed it into a Sandwich which threw me off. I asked you guys don’t cut it off a skewer he said no… not that it matters but that’s literally what shawerma is. I asked for pickles which is usually standard in shawerma sandwich and they charge extra for that it’s a dollar more but anything I put in it they charge for. Total was like $16. when in Jersey I can get a sandwich bigger and tastier for less and more sides in it. Look the sandwich was not bad in flavor it tasted good and the staff were great  and all that just needs a little more presentable way of making the food! And a little more flavor to the meat.
