We did not like any items in the 2nd mood board she sent and requested a revision for more options, and she declined to refresh/revise it until we bought anything from her 1st mood board.

Then suggested us a 41 inch chandelier for a small round informal dining table– in short, too big for the table.\nNo renderings (2D or 3D) were provided despite mentioning it in the contract – the mood boards were really just pictures of wall arts and chairs dumped on ~10 slides- again, very average and couldn’t find anything striking that we loved. She even frowned upon her time used for creating a PO.\nWe found her as a sales consultant at best, and not a designer. We have got nothing close to the $1000 we spent on her. Have now resorted to Modsy’s online design team who have provided us 10 renderings for a minimal cost, and options to actually view and test the products they’re trying to sell us via visiting the stores and trying them.
