I don’t recommend for many reasons: 1) the waiting room is always congested. So many sick children next to each other. My two kids have gotten sick about 3/6 times that we were there. It’s disgusting.\n2) the waiting is horrible. At least 2-3 hours every time! It’s crazy. They accept walk ins until like 3pm so it doesn’t matter if you have an appt or not. They go by your name on the list.\n3) the doctor himself, Marino Torres. At first I thought he was nice and patient. Then after I established a relationship with him after coming for more than one appointment (I have two kids), I realized he is just a regular mainstream doctor. He doesn’t care for healing my children. Everything is “normal” to him. I’ve seen five-star, great doctors that specialize in orthodontics and myofunctional therapy. They said my son has a tongue tie and swollen adenoids that affect his breathing, which is why he mouth breaths and snores. It can be due to allergies so they recommended seeing an allergist and ENT. I told Marino torres my concerns because I needed a referral script due to my insurance, and he said, “Who told you this? That is normal for kids. You won’t like what the ENT will tell you. I’ll do it for you, but this isn’t how I practice medicine; giving referrals.” I was like what? Really? So I can’t see a specialist as long as I’m your patient because I must listen to your medical opinion?? Lol! Wow. I’m so glad I changed pediatricians because he doesn’t care about my children’s health! Why would I want a doctor who just turns the other way when he should be concerned? He doesn’t like that I see other specialists because he thinks he’s the best doctor, which he isn’t! He doesn’t even know about mthfr, or care to learn! I brought it up because many of us have it and it can teach us a lot about our bodies and what we can handle (methyl system etc). He had to google it and then said it’s nothing smh.\nAnother example, my son has had a rash on his arm forever. He has seen it 2 times during appointments and just said to put Vaseline. Wow. I asked for a referral for the dermatologist and he gave me problems again. Wow. It was a sign of eczema and gluten intolerance. My child will be tested for celiac disease. All this was prolonged because he didn’t care. It’s scary to think a parent out there will follow what he says and not care enough to HEAL.\nIf you care about your children’s health, don’t put their lives in the hands of a doctor who isn’t educated and isn’t effective or actively trying to understand your children’s body."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I chose Marino Torres because he was in network with my insurance and close by.
