From the get go, he was extremely sweet and professional, and made it very clear that he wanted us to be happy and our guests to have a great time. His responsiveness was prompt and complete. He had a very thorough song and preference list, and we felt like he really listened to us and gave us everything that we wanted and more.\n\nOur ceremony music went off without a hitch, music during dinner was really enjoyable - the right relaxed tempo, and I even recognized a couple of songs that are old favorites of mine (but not super well known), and we had a solid dance party happen after dinner. He even checked in with me a couple of times throughout the night to make sure that he was on the right path - and I had nothing but encouragement to give him.\n\nWe have received so many compliments on just how good our DJ was. A couple of my relatives, who have been to a lot of weddings and are hard to please, even dared to call him the *best* wedding DJ that they have ever experienced.
