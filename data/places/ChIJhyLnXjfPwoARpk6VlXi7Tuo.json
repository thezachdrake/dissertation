Exterminator put a temporary shield up to block the holes and the rat was caught but now I had zero protection from rain and I had a river flowing through my garage during the last storm.  My exterminator let me know about a specific weather strip for rodent prevention and to replace it with one of those\n\nAfter searching around for a garage door company that did repairs I found OC Local Fix.  There was several reviews mentioning they replaced weather stripping.  I contact them via yelp messenger and was contacted by Kristen within about 10 minutes to set me up for an appointment the next day.  Texting and yelp messages were replied to very quickly.\n\nJoe came out and reviewed what type of door I had and said he needed to order the part.  The part was delayed due to the recent rains causing high demand so the original install date had to be pushed.  Only issue I had is when my original appointment was missed due to the part delay I wasn't notified so I was sitting at home waiting and frustrated.  Joe though made up for it by coming as soon as he got the part even though it was late at night.\n\nI assumed replacing a weather strip would be easy but nope, this was a real pain of a job that took over an hour so I'm glad I hired the pros and not attempted it myself.  The rodent resistant weather strip has a thick barrier inside woven with metal fibers that rats do not like to chew threw.  It's super thick compared to my old barrier.  Since it was night time it was hard to tell if it was sealed completely.  Next morning some sunlight shining through so Joe came out immediately and made a few adjustments.  Now the barrier is completely sealed and will hopefully keep the rats out of my property!\n\nThank you Joe and Kristen (and the second technician who's name I can't recall)!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"During a rat exclusion trying to get rid of a rat in my attic it was able to get into my garage through the wall.
