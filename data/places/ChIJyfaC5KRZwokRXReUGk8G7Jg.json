I was *literally* spending about 15 hours a month dealing with these people, just trying to get them to do simple refills of meds I've been on for years. Literally every single refill is a project that takes hours. I thought nobody could be worse than CVS, but somehow this pharmacy has managed it.\n\nBTW, in case you're wondering why I would keep showing up in person and waiting on line, instead of calling to check if my script was ready: it's because they usually don't answer the phone.

Unfortunately, their attitude seems to be, \"If the patient isn't visibly upset about being denied their medication, then they must not really need it, so we can continue ignoring them and playing games with them.\"\n\nSometimes it's just not feasible to call the doctor and have a new script sent to a different pharmacy. In that case you just basically have to stay in the pharmacy and nag them into doing their jobs. It's like they're goldfish or something; they can't remember anything that happened more than 2 seconds ago. As soon as you step away from the counter, they forget you exist. So you have to stand there and keep reminding them.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be so hard on them. CVS on 93rd & Broadway is almost as bad. Don't go there either.

I spoke to the other pharmacist who confirmed with insurance that was it reversed the day before. She tried to speak to Benazir to help resolve the issue bc insurance said they were entering the dose and quantity incorrectly and that’s why claim wasn’t going through. However, Benazir was rude and unwilling to work with the pharmacist, insurance or me to resolve issue for the longest time.  Furthermore, EMY, Pharmacy Technician, chimed in, yelling and offering her two cents. It was a nightmare trying to get my dad’s medication through this pharmacy. Rude, unprofessional and inefficient staff, mainly just Benazir and Emy. It didn’t appear busy; just one customer ahead of me. Also, Signa insurance confirmed we shouldn’t have any issues getting meds from DR because the claim was reversed the day before. Go elsewhere for your medication. It’s not worth it. This is the  worst pharmacy service I’ve ever experienced."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Recently my parents moved to the UWS.
