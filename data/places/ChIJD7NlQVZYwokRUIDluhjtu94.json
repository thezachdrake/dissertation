To be frank this is what turned a 1 star review into 3 stars. With out this interaction I would’ve been left with the frustrations of the room condition when we finally checked in.. Some of the light switches didn’t work, the blinds wouldn’t come down, the apple play didn’t work well, and the shower door didn’t shut. I expected the room to be pretty tight for 2 as I’ve had the pleasure of visiting a location in Seattle (newer property). It just seemed much tighter. The maintenance guy was able to come in & get the blinds unstuck but had to step on our BED in order to do so. At least they got a sheet I suppose. I understand with it being the new year, allot of places are booked but we were pretty disappointed in them not being able to accommodate us with a different room after notifying them of the first 15 minutes of being there of the room’s condition. Anyway, to end this review on a positive note, the location is great if your aim is to be in time square. Pretty walkable to great eats and entertainment.

This time I decided to try the chat and waited 40 minutes to speak to a real person, who basically told me I could try calling the central number again, because \"there is no direct number\". After pushing for a more reasonable solution, they said they would have the front desk call me back. They did eventually call me back 8 hours later to let me know they did not find the ring.\n\nNext time I will book at a hotel that wants to assist their patrons in solving basic problems. You should not have sit on hold for hours to ask a simple question."},"publishTime":"2024-01-10T21:26:14Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.76305498029151,"longitude":-73.98353706970849},"low":{"latitude":40.76035701970851,"longitude":-73.9862350302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","shortFormattedAddress":"218 W 50th St, New York"}
