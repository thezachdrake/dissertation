Their green sauce was amazing, the freshness and spiciness of the sauce simply pushed the flavor of the food into next level.  Happy with their service.

Sophie Cuban might be a suitable option for those seeking a budget-friendly meal with generous portions. However, those expecting a higher-end restaurant experience or authentic Cuban flavors may be left wanting more.\n\nOverall, Sophie Cuban Restaurant offers value for money, but the culinary experience and ambiance didn't match our hoped-for Cuban charm.
