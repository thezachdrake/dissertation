Unfortunately my grandmother passed away and I had to reschedule my initial appointment, but finally made it in. Again,the office called me the day before to confirm my appointment, never once mentioning that they won’t honor my insurance. After coming in to the office, they told me they actually WON’T accept my insurance, even though I’ve been a patient for many years. They said if I had an appointment earlier, they would’ve taken it. Remember, I did have an appointment earlier,  but had to reschedule due to the death of my grandmother.\n\nI am so disappointed. I understand doctors can select to accept the insurance they want- but they specifically told me they’d take it from me. I wouldn’t have lost a personal day otherwise and wouldn’t have made this appointment.\n\nBesides this, I’m a healthy 35 year old female with zero heart disease in my family and for years, every time I went in for a physical, they did an EKG. I was naive and thought that was normal, until I spoke to friends in the medical field. Turns out this office likes to run all kinds of unnecessary tests in order to charge insurance.\nKept that in for a long time because I wanted to give them benefit of the doubt.
