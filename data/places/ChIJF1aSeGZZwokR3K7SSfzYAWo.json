I loved the bright purple hue of the potato paste, it’s so very eye catching.  The overall mouth texture was smooth and creamy with small chunks of apple.  It was very mildly sweet, and I thought the apples worked well here.\n\nHoji-cha Caramel Banana ($18): this had layers of chocolate cream, banana custard, and caramel sauce.  This was my favorite.  The banana custard with chocolate cream works so well.  I actually ate this in one sitting and didn’t share.\n\nYou can tell all the desserts were meticulously constructed.  They taste surprisingly light and not overly sweet. They are both sophisticated and fun at the same time.  The size of the desserts is also spot on.  It’s big enough to share or to save for another time.  The desserts are on the higher end, as far as price is concerned, but I think it is worth it, in my opinion.\n\nThey change up the flavors of their cheese tarts often which is nice.  I hope to try more items in the future, but it does require some planning ahead due to their limited hours of operations.\n\nTip: their operating hours change every week, so check their Instagram account for updates"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"These unique cat-themed Japanese cheese tarts first showed up on my IG feed last year and I promptly bookmarked the shop to try at some point.
