I wouldn’t recommend going for tailoring unless you have to. Initially, the customer service was friendly and helpful. I got a number of pants tailored, but they made three mistakes on them. First, it was hard to get them to admit they made the mistakes in the first place, but eventually they admitted it after I kept pointing it out and they measured some things. They told me they were going to fix the mistakes  and add tapering to one pair of pants “on the house”. But then, “surprise”… when I went to pick up the pants, they charged me $20 for the taper and said I was the one confused about the situation. They said the fixes “on the house” were for the mistakes THEY made in the first place. Why would that be “on the house” when it is something I already paid for, and THEY made the mistakes? For example, one of the mistakes was one hemmed pant leg was clearly longer than the other. How is fixing their error “on the house”? Don’t go. At best, they are “nice people” initially, but if your experience is like mine they will do a poor rushed job, then you will have to fight for them to admit and fix the things, then they will confuse you with their prices and say “you” are the one who is mistaken. Not worth it. An initial hopeful experience turned sour by poor quality, running from responsibility, communicating in a misleading way, and then overcharging me."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I wanted to like this place, but it was more of a hassle than it was helpful.
