I've even ordered one of those mattresses (Dreambed Lux) and am having it shipped to London ! Rebecca, the Landlady, was super helpful, \"checking me in\" on arrival. Throughout the stay, nothing was too much trouble. If I needed extra towels, pillows, or anything needed fixing, it was done the same day. Mariesela will clean the apartment for a small extra fee, but it was so worth it, as the place would be gleaming when I got home. Greenwich Village is my favorite neighborhood, and the apartment couldn't be better placed. There are so many great restaurants right on your doorstep, plus a dry cleaners and supermarket just around the corner. My favorite part of the day was getting home in the evening and sitting on my balcony overlooking the rear gardens and apartments opposite. It was just like \"Rear Window\" !
