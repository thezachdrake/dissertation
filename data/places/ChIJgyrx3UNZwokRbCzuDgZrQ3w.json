to refill a few simple, bog-standard prescriptions. Even the simplest refill is a hassle that takes hours to sort out, so if you love being aggravated and wasting time, this is your spot.\n\nI initially wrote a very long review detailing all of the issues I've had with them, but I feel like it's simpler and easier to follow if I just give you a rundown of what an average experience at this pharmacy is like.\n\nMe: \"Hi, I got a text saying my Wellbutrin was ready for pickup. The name is LJ, birthdate XX/XX/XXXX.\"\n\nUseless Pharmacy Technician: \"No, I'm not seeing that in the system. But if you need it, we can have it ready for you in an hour.\"\n\n*5 hours later*\n\nMe: \"Hi, I'm here to pick up my Wellbutrin. LJ, birthdate XX/XX/XXXX.\"\n\nUPT: \"Oh, that's actually out of stock. But if you need it, we can order it and have it for you in 3 days.\"\n\n*4 days later*\n\nMe: \"Hi, I'm here to pick up my Wellbutrin. LJ, birthdate XX/XX/XXXX.\"\n\nDifferent But Equally Useless Pharmacy Technician: \"No, I'm not seeing that in the system. But if you need it, we can have it ready for you in an hour.\"\n\nThis is the point where I've learned to just give up and call my doctor to have a new prescription sent to a different pharmacy. Because this Kafkaesque nightmare could go on for weeks.\n\nAt this point there's only 1 medication left that I'm still getting from this Duane Reade. I was *literally* spending about 15 hours a month dealing with these people, just trying to get them to do simple refills of meds I've been on for years. Literally every single refill is a project that takes hours. I thought nobody could be worse than CVS, but somehow this pharmacy has managed it.\n\nBTW, in case you're wondering why I would keep showing up in person and waiting on line, instead of calling to check if my script was ready: it's because they usually don't answer the phone. They leave you on hold for at least 30 minutes and then half the time they just hang up on you.\n\nIf you show up in person, you'll still have to wait on line for 30 minutes, but at least they can't hang up on you.\n\nThere have been times I have raised my voice or otherwise expressed visible frustration, and gotten results. But I really don't like having to do that. Unfortunately, their attitude seems to be, \"If the patient isn't visibly upset about being denied their medication, then they must not really need it, so we can continue ignoring them and playing games with them.\"\n\nSometimes it's just not feasible to call the doctor and have a new script sent to a different pharmacy. In that case you just basically have to stay in the pharmacy and nag them into doing their jobs. It's like they're goldfish or something; they can't remember anything that happened more than 2 seconds ago. As soon as you step away from the counter, they forget you exist. So you have to stand there and keep reminding them.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be so hard on them. CVS on 93rd & Broadway is almost as bad. Don't go there either. They like to do this fun thing where they pretend your doctor never sent the script at all. That way they don't have to bother filling it.
