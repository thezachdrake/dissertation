I could not think of a better group of dedicate teachers and staff who help everyone (parents included) making the transition from (for many kids) being at home to being in school.  They all are so loving and caring that most morning drop-offs where without fuss, my son loved being there and felt loved so he was not anxious when mommy had to leave.  I love that they allow the kids to express themselves, play dress up in anything they feel like wearing, you could be a fireman princess or a chef ballet dancer, they just let kids explore and engage. We had such a positive experience and Eileen is so devoted to her students and school and it really shows truly by how loved the kids feel.  My son who is now 10 still remembers very well what his classrooms there looked like and talks about the \"music man\" (Willy) who would come to play music with the kids.  You can not find a better program for 2s and 3s then Little Mish and we looked at them all.
