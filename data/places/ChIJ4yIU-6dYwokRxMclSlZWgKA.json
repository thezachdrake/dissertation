Their facilities look and feel brand-new, there is plenty of natural light, and the center is designed to feel like a small school to help students transition from the center to a school building. I spent a day shadowing my son's class and I saw the teachers speaking lovingly and intentionally to the students. When one student started to get wound up, the teacher stopped the distraction quickly and explained to the student that his action concerned her not only for the other children's safety but also for that child's safety (a very child centered classroom). The curriculum is appropriately rigorous and allows ample play time for each developmental stage.  The director of the school has her PhD in Early Childhood Edu/Dev, is very personable, and hands on - she is often found in the classroom interacting with the students (when us parents aren't tying her up lol).  The icing on the cake, our son came to Sunshine after being at two other daycare centers - at both the previous centers he was content. He would go in and come back - no real highs or lows.  After his first day at Sunshine, however, we were leaving and he asked, \"Mommy, can I stay longer to play with my new friends?\" On his second day, when he caught sight of the center on our walk there, he said, \"There's my school! It's my favorite!\" To this day, his excitement for school stays high.  Our whole family loves the experience we've received here and will keep our (now) two children in this center until Kindergarten.  Trusting someone with your child can be a tough decision (it was for us, which is why this was our third and last center to enroll our son in) but I hope this review helps you see you can trust this center - making your decision a little easier. They also use an app called Tadpoles that sends you photos of your child throughout the day, which is just heart warming. Such a phenomenal center! Hope to see you around the center soon."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Sunshine at Lexington & 101 is the best daycare in the area.
