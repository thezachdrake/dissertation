Color belts and instructors are always willing to help white belts improve, answer their questions, and drill/roll with them. Often as a white belt, I will find myself at open mat rolling with Brown/Black belts, who are always happy to give detailed feedback on tweaks, details, and improvements to my moves. My understanding is that this level of feedback is not the norm across gyms and is a testament to the culture here, which promotes an attitude of helping to develop newer people. After bringing a friend that has trained at several gyms over the last few years, he was likewise impressed with the humble and collaborative attitude of the people here at Fabio Clemente.\nThe beginner classes frequently have two instructors and ~10-15 participants meaning that you get lots of personalized direction and attention which helps to accelerate your progression and ensure you are not improperly drilling complex movements. Typically, beginner classes include ~ 15min of warmup/individual drills, ~30min of paired drills, and ~15min of specific sparring.\nI highly encourage anyone interested in the sport or looking to switch gyms to give Fabio Clemente a shot!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is an excellent gym for beginners and higher belts looking to join a gym with a positive culture and excellent instruction.\nI started training here as a new white belt ~7 months ago.
