She was a born in Brooklyn Hospital on February 20, 1983, and was throwing up bile shortly after birth. They wanted to do a biopsy which, they say, might have required a blood transfusion. My husband and I are Jehovah’s Witnesses and we we’re given the name of Dr Ginsburg, who was on a list of doctors who would work with Jehovah’s Witnesses, as we do not accept blood transfusions. He had our daughter air lifted from Brooklyn Hospital to NYC Medical Center, did the biopsy and discovered she had Hirschsprung’s Disease. He performed her first operation when she was 8 days old, giving her a colostomy. She had to make several additional trips back and forth to the hospital before her 1st birthday and he was always there, assisting with her care. Then, when she was 10 months old, he reversed the colostomy. He always took the time to discuss her care with me and my husband, always being frank and honest about the possible outcome. We fully trusted Dr Ginsburg, and always felt he had our daughters best interest at heart. Shortly after that, we moved away from NY to NC, but Dr Ginsburg made arrangements for her follow up care at UNC Chapel Hill Hospital and forwarded all of her pertinent information, as she required two additional surgeries when she was 5 and 6 years old. She is now 35, and has a child of her own, but she knows the story about Dr Ginsburg, and just how much we appreciated all he did for us. We are eternally grateful for his expertise, knowledge, bedside manner and compassion. I was amazed to see that he is still practicing, but I couldn’t recommend him enough. Thanks Dr Ginsburg.
