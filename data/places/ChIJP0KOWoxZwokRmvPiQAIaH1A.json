Also, all of the food here is going to be extravagant and not particular healthy, so be sure to pace yourself and balance things out.\n\nHere are a few things I’ve tried:\n\nDKA - One of the best pastries I’ve ever eaten, ever. If you have to choose between this and the cronut, this is probably the one to get. It’s a kouign-amann, which is similar to a very buttery croissant. It uses a similarly laminated dough and is brushed with a sweet syrup and finished with a little bit of salt. It’s well balanced between sweet and savory and it isn’t too sweet. It’s a very satisfying thing to eat and I don’t know how anyone could ever get sick of this.\n\nCronut - Perfect layers, coated with sugar, filled with delicious ganache, and perfectly fried. The flavors change every month and have never repeated ever since the pastry debuted. I’ve been lucky enough to try the apricot and caramelia flavor as well as the ube and coconut. Both were otherworldly and decadent.\n\nBlossoming Hot Chocolate - This was very cool and quite novel to see, but the actual drink was nothing special. The drink is poured in to the cup while a marshmallow flower floats to the top and opens up and “blossoms”. It wasn’t bad and it was certainly nice on a cold day. While the presentation was impressive and unlike anything I’d seen, I don’t know if I’d do it again.\n\nCanele - A lovely little pastry that combined the flavors of vanilla and rum.  These are small, but mighty. The outer crust is perfectly caramelized while the inside is a tender, airy, custard center. This can be a difficult thing to make without burning them and each time I’ve had them, they were absolutely perfect.\n\nCookie Shot - One of the more unique things the shop offers. This is a cookie that is formed into the shape of a shot glass. You then pour in a small vial of their vanilla milk and give it a moment to soak into the cookie. You can then drink the milk and eat the softened cookie. The flavors come together well and this was a unique way to enjoy milk and cookies. The cookie itself was perfectly balanced and I wasn’t prepared for how much I’d enjoy it when combined with the milk."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Does it live up to the hype?
