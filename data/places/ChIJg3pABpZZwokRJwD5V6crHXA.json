I had my two year old daughter with me and had to end up taking the subway and train back to jersey at 1230am because they were closed. I spoke to a gentlemen who works next door and he said people fall for this trap all the time- they end up getting stranded at late hours of the night with no car. Common courtesy would be to let customers know closing times (especially if they pull up to park in the evening!). Or post up a bigger sign! But they're just out for your money.
