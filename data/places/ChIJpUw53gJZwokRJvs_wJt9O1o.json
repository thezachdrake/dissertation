Please read: Opened response to Col David R Gibson, Commander DARNALL Hosp FtHood TX: ........On May 31 2017 you retaliated by declaring me barred from entering DARNALL & from receiving copies of my prescr/med. records - citing your spokesperson: \"because I had the audacity to report the drug theft to fed authorities to initiate a drug investigation\". Who do you think you are? You think you have the right to destroy your patients' lives so you can commit & conceal your crimes. You expressed your intent to manipulate the FtHood Command into banning me from post. You are even more crim. than I thought. Since I left DARNALL for good in June 2017, you continue to beg the off-post providers I try to see not to accept me as a patient, tell them lies about me & keep sending them your falsified prescr/med records \"as proof\". You fail continually to send them your 2016 apology letter. This behavior is not restricted to med.providers. You called my MVA lawyer's office & lied to them that \"I am a criminal who is in serious trouble with the police & have been arrested\", etc. I have never been arrested & I was never in my life in trouble with the law. Your intent was to manipulate my lawyer into terminating me as a client, because he asks you to release my med.records; you don't want to release your forged mess to him, incl.the prescr.lists, because you are afraid you could incriminate yourselves with your product if an attorney gets a hold of It. What is the problem for the delay since summer? Need to update forgeries so nothing self-incriminating gets released? You distribute my records to businesses all over Texas without my permission - why is my attorney excluded? You filed 2 liens against the car insurances to get 'reimbursed' for bounced visits of mine during which you did nothing else but denying me med.care for the MVA injuries. You even billed them for drugs your staff diverted. We need the records, so there will be a settlement, you receive your undeserved money for services not performed, & lift your liens.- You claim that from May till Oct 2017 I was supposedly \"continually misbehaving\" in DARNALL. I did not frequent your casino in the alleged timeframe. Did you forget that you had declared on May 31 that I am not allowed to enter DARNALL anymore, because I reported your drug theft to the CID? I had no PCM for a month & finally convinced Tricare to let me sign out of DARNALL & switch to off-post PCMs - because you deny me access to med.care. You did not like that development & tried in vain to reassign me to DARNALL. I cannot be assigned to a facility I am not allowed to enter, where med.care is denied if I enter, my rec. are getting forged, & false crim accusations pop up after every visit I made. After I left, you continued to compose consult.reports of me supposedly appearing for appts in DARNALL, at least through Aug 2017 (you faxed copies to my doctors). Your staff also kept pilfering contr. subst. from the pharm, wrote them on my tab, and faxed it to my providers. I don't want to be a DARNALL patient; I want to go to real doctors & ethical hospitals off post - not to your corrupt quacks. I want you to stop messing with my off-post med.care & my med.documentation, and to stop stealing prescr.meds using my patient ID data.Just one of many examples:  in May 2017 you referred me to a Dr.Marsh. Some DARNALL employee named Valerie Laroco called his Killeen office, advised him not to accept the referral you sent him, told them invented crime srories about me & sent forged records as \"proof\". I was informed about your minion's calls & denied as a patient, of course. The same person called me on June 1 2017, threatening to get my husband fired from his job because I went to the CID. After that call we started to receive up to 30 hang-up calls per day for several months (all from DARNALL acc to ID box). - All your threats & lies in your letters serve only the purpose of preventing a drug investigation & to avoid a public scandal..........Last part posted under \"Sirikit Park\""},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"The 2nd part of \"Jamie Foxxx\" posting.
