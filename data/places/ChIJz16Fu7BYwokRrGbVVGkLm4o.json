Kaplan was assigned to do a custody evaluation, of Myself, my son and my son's father.

Kaplan stated I made \"baseless\" allegations of harassment against my son's father, in spite of my son's father sending me harassing and threatening e-mails, text messages, letters and other harassing materials to my home. My son's father ignored Orders of Protection, which led to hearings, which found him guilty of violating the Orders of Protection and led to my son's father being jailed TWICE, for violating said Orders. Kaplan criticized my family members, including my PARENTS, none of whom he ever met or had contact with. Kaplan invented stories about Myself and my family and lied through his teeth, to make himself sound more authentic. Kaplan stated in his report that I was a \"thorn, in my son's side\" and he was miserable with me. Nothing could be further from the truth. My son and I are very close, in spite of the evil spewed by Kaplan and his grievous attempts, to destroy our relationship. Meanwhile, Kaplan literally made EXCUSES, for my son's father's alcoholism, including the statement that my son's father HAD to have SEVERAL alcoholic drinks, before arriving to pick up our son, because he was so \"afraid\" of dealing with me! More accurately; I held him accountable for his actions. Kaplan minimized ANY negative mention of my son's father or his relatives. Kaplan went so far as to make my son's paternal grandmother out to be some type of beauty queen, who was \"fiercely independent \", in spite of her raising her entire family, on FULL WELFARE, in addition to other handouts. Kaplan recommended that my son (who has ADHD & is on the Autism spectrum), be IMMEDIATELY removed from my care and custody and NEVER have contact with me again, regardless of the devastating impact this would have on my son. I IMMEDIATELY, filed a complaint with the COMMITTEE OF PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL CONDUCT. I enclosed a copy of Kaplan's report. I was told it was the WORST report they have ever seen and was HIGHLY BIASED! Word of Kaplan's report about me circulated through the Bronx Court and beyond and NO JUDGE OR LAWYER would hire him. Kaplan went from being a daily fixture, in the court, for YEARS, to NEVER being seen again!!! Robert J. Kaplan is INCOMPETENT!!! The reason he was hired at all, is because his rates were CHEAPER, than a COMPETENT PSYCHIATRIST & the court thought they could save some money. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! Kaplan is someone who should be AVOIDED  like the PLAGUE!!! Kaplan is a DISGRACE to BOTH the MEDICAL and MENTAL HEALTH professions. As for my son's father, he and his wife were recently INDICATED (found GUILTY) for CHILD ABUSE against my son. Charges are pending."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My experience with Robert Kaplan was HORRIFIC.
