I repeat, DO NOT waste your time with Dr. Lentnek and this practice.  Dr. Lentek is the most condescending and unprofessional person I have ever met.  When I was originally researching this doctor there were many other negative reviews that have seemed to have been wiped off of google that all explained similar stories.  It was only because of my network and location, that I had to visit him in the Smithtown location.  Let me begin.... As I walked into his office for the first time, there was a young gentleman with his mother screaming at the receptionist.  The young man had a visible rash on his leg, but for some reason Dr Lentnek told him he was making it up and nothing was wrong with him.  I was very confused. After they left, the mother felt the need to come back into the office and call him back out of the office to display her discontent.  It was one of the most uncomfortable waiting room scenarios I have ever been in.  I knew something was wrong right then and there.  When I was brought back to his office, 2 minutes into my evaluation his cell phone rang and he asked me to wait a minute as he put his speaker phone on.  The person calling was confirming his travel reservations.  For the next 5 minutes he had me hold as he confirmed his flight.... are you kidding me?!? After he hung up, I explained my symptoms to him.  He then went online and found an extremely rare auto-immune disease that barley fit the descriptions of my symptoms and proclaimed that he though this is what I had.  Mind you, he did not run any tests on me, we were only talking. He prescribed a random medication and sent me for a general blood test and told me to come back in two weeks.  Knowing that it was very unlikely to have this autoimmune disease that only exists in Western Europe, I printed out some other possibilities from the Mayo Clinic and CDC webpage.  When I returned and asked him how could we test my symptoms with an actual test he became irritated and grabbed a medical journal off of his shelf, threw it down on the desk, and told me to go read it.  All I was asking for was a medical test.  He offered nothing.  I asked him what he would do if he was in my situation and he told me he would do nothing.  I came to him for help and was scolded like a toddler for asking how to test my condition.  Do not waste your time with this man."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"DO NOT!
