There are NO words to describe how incredible Dr. Ward is. Short and to the point - he is AMAZING! By far the BEST chiropractor I've ever been to. He’s extremely knowledgeable, explains everything in detail and is thorough. I go to him on my 1-hour lunch break and he always gets me in and out fast (so that I’m never late getting back to work). His office is sanitary/clean and runs like a well-oiled machine (you’re in and out fast and you get an excellent adjustment, not a rushed adjustment). He has never failed to adjust my back and neck (without hurting me). My headaches are gone and I sleep MUCH better. I can’t really say enough positive things about Dr. Ward! Now for the office staff, Shawnee (at the front desk) is really really really incredible. Whenever I call at the last minute and want to see the doctor, she ALWAYS squeezes me in. She’s an elegant, lovely and pleasant lady who brightens up the entire office. While she isn’t a doctor, she really adds something special just by being a kind and sweet person (not to mention incredibly accommodating when fitting in last minute patients like me).
