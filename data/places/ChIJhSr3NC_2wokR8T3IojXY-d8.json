He is using a special equipment with electrodes which I did not see in any other PT places where I went before. Using the electrodes, he is applying small electric fields at the area of the injury and I really feel how my ankle is rapidly improving with each visit to his place. The two young ladies who are assisting him are also very nice. Beside using the device with the electrodes Mr Panayotidis can understand very well my surgery and ankle problems and his massage around my damaged ankle is very good and  helping my ankle to improve.
