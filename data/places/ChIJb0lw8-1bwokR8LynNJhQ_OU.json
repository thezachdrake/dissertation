We arrived on time checked in, showed our vaccination cards and were assigned a cabin almost immediately. The cabin we were assigned (A7) had no heat. It was 22 degrees. We told our attendant and she promptly found a new cabin that was well heated. The view was truly spectacular. We brought along our 6 year old and he was so excited that he could see the Statue of Liberty. We scan the QR code on the table, ordered from our phone and paid at the same time. We looked up the menu prior to coming so it helped us with deciding. The attendant didn't know much about the menu when asked how food items were prepared or whether they were sweet/spicy. Menu options are very limited, so is the alcohol. However, we  viewed the menu prior to coming so we knew what to expect. Our attendant recommended ordering then taking a stroll for the view. That was a great suggestion as our food came as soon as we took a walk around the rooftop. It is 90 minute for each reservation but they weren't strict with the time limit (which was good for us). Overall the experience was good. Would definitely go back. The best thing on the menu is the Buttermilk Fried Chicken - trust me!! We ordered quite a few things from the menu and really liked the fried chicken. It was so good we ordered a second one. I love the concept (perfect for the current COVID world) but I would recommend a BYOB in addition to their alcohol offerings. It is was way too limited. I had the rum punch, it was a small can, but was good. No kids menu if you're bringing a little one. My recommendations are more variety in the food and alcohol selections and BYOB would be a great addition to this concept.
