Here's why: After going through breast cancer Surgery successfully, the extremely powerful medicine I was put on (to be taken for 5 years) was Causing me to feel such extreme depression that I was contemplating suicide for the first time in my life.  My oncologist told me I had no other drug options and dismissed my complaints by ignoring them.  But the emotional pain and suffering I experienced due to hormonal changes from that medicine actually caused me to think I might be better off ending my life!  When I went for an annual check up with Dr. Lila she immediately noticed the extreme change in my demeanor and we talked and talked for a long time. She requested all of my records on the breast cancer, all images, reports, lab results, oncologists notes, surgeons notes, etc.  After reviewing everything she recommended a different medication and referred me to a different oncologist to verify that the medication would be safe and effective for me.  I switched meds and less than 1 month later I was myself again.  I really don't know what would have happened to me if I had continued on that first medication.\nI will be moving out of state soon but will fly to NY at least once a year for my annual exams with Dr. Lila because I have so much confidence in her."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have seen Dr. Lila for almost 20 years.
