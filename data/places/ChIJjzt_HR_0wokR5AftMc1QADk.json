That is where this medical visit concluded. I waited until 2:49pm to make my way to the front desk and asked for the manger of the clinic. She was nowhere to be found and I was told she was in and out of meetings. I waited OVER TWO AND A HALF HOURS to not be seen by my “primary health provider”. I ordered a Lyft to arrive to my appointment early and it resulted in being a complete waste of money and time. I am still waiting to hear back from the clinic’s manager as I did not receive any medical checkup of any kind, and also would like my ride to the clinic compensated. It’s sad after so many years to switch healthcare providers but at this point it’s a must unless I plan to spend the entire day there.
