For brunch I did the shrimp with grits and it was very filling. My cousin had the chicken nachos. I’m definitely coming back for the chicken nachos!!! A little confusion was at the front desk with the hostess. Nothing that could have ruined the experience (it was a beautiful sunny day) but… I think it needs to be clear on how the host responds to questions from guest, and also if someone books a reservation and the policy is “you can be sat outside or indoors; based on what we decide when you arrive…” then specify that with guest during the reservation phase. You can not expect anyone to just accept you sitting them outdoors against their will; and the weather is also crisp because it’s autumn. The outdoors was not heated so be very clear on the policy upfront. Other than that minor hiccup, the entire experience was a cool vibe. Welcoming, and it was great to see so many familiar faces from the community. ~ Tiffany"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Did a Sunday Brunch; just a party of 2 around noon.
