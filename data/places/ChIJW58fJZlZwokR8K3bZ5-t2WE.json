The first time I went there (Black Sabbath Poster) The Wonderfull Mary Dryden instantly started helping me and going over options for the concert print. Mary was very open to my opinions of the frame and mating options. She was also saying how much she loved the print and how she thought it was so pretty and well done. Mary also always lets me pay for the framing in stages which is very nice. While I was having my first print done with them I went in to make another payment and Mary had saved a news paper printing for me of the Black Sabbath concert that I had gone to. That really shows that she and all the staff that work there are very caring about their customers.
