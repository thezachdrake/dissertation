This by far is one of the worst nail salons I have ever been to in my entire existence on this earth.

She was talking about 10 dollars and than 8 dollars extra. I really didn't think nothing of it because i expected it to be cheap. (Come to find out its 40 dollars just for gel)\nAfter I'm done I go to Sean. (Yes i remembered your name)I got square acrylic nails they were short because I don't like long nails. This man did not even clean my cuticles or push they back for that part. He basically flooded my cuticle beds with acrylic, and made a whole mess around my fingers. He put to much top coat on and got it on the sides of my fingernail and got some acrylic on some of my fingers and didn't even bother to clean it off. Just to tell me to wash my hands and it will come off.\nI've never been so disappointed in my life i got my nails done because im taking graduation photos on 12/3/2021 and i wanted to look nice and this is how i get treated. If not that to make it worst they charged me 58 dollars for the feet and then 70 for the hands. In total i had to pay 128 dollars for horrible service. Of course I left without giving a tip.\nThen like maybe 15 minutes later my mom came back with me to the salon and literally had to get a little loud to get these people to fix my nails which SEAN barely even fixed and had an attitude after.
