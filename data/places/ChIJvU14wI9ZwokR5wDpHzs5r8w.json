He said he could show me how some speakers would sound better with the proper amp driving them and what the differences were that I should listen for. I set up an appointment and Glenn gave my wife and I a private demo to help us decide. The equipment I was considering was at the high end of the equipment they carried so the demo was long and we needed to return for some final decision making. Glenn was extremely patient and answered all of our questions. He made it easy to compare the different components and assess the virtues of each. In the end the choice was obvious to us and there was no doubt that I found what I was looking for. My wife and I both preferred the intimacy of having a private demo rather than the walk-in experience with many interruptions.

I’ll be retiring in a few years and I figured the next speakers I get would probably be the last so I wanted to stretch myself and buy the best system possible.
