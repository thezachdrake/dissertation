You are guaranteed to receive instructional and informative emails from David and his team that are easy to understand. They update and touch base with you often and if there is ever a question or concern they are quick to respond. This is greatly reassuring because at this time where you don't necessarily see a face or hear a voice, I have found that with many other businesses, the quality of service has declined. In some cases, it has become much harder to reach staff and oftentimes you get the feeling they're working with much less staff. Not so with this team and that has been most comforting. The quality of service has by no means lessened. If anything, their support may have become even more enhanced.
