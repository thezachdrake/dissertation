I had rough days while he was my tutor, this was not a bad thing. I needed to be uncomfortable so I could grow as a student and pass that LSAT.  Milan will make sure you understand and try multiple avenues to achieve that. I am TERRIBLE at test taking, however, with his help and my due diligence I received a 152 as my LSAT score. I know it's pretty average but knowing how I take tests and learn it was difficult and achieving that score the first time around I was thrilled.
