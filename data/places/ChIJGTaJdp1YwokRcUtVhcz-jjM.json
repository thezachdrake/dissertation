Received a call today (9/19) that my appointment is now cancelled. Called the pharmacy to reschedule and they told me to rebook online. The soonest appointment would be for Oct. 3rd. Whoever I spoke with was completely unhelpful and rude. Also, why would a pharmacy be closed on a Tuesday? Do people not need meds and pharmacists on Tuesdays anymore? Terrible policy."},"publishTime":"2022-09-19T23:53:14Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.793199280291496,"longitude":-73.9671138197085},"low":{"latitude":40.790501319708504,"longitude":-73.96981178029151}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":9,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":21,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":8,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":22,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":8,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":22,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":8,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":22,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":8,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":22,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":8,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":22,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":9,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":21,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Saturday: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Sunday: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"700 Columbus Ave, New York"}
