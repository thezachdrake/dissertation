He has at least one judgment against him and in 2018 there was an investigation and proceeding against him and 7 of his companies by the Florida Attorney General’s Office for alleged unfair and deceptive acts towards consumers, resulting in  civil penalties totaling at least $570,000 being assessed against him and his companies.  He signed an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance with the Attorney General's Office at that time which evidently did not change his behavior.\nUnfortunately, I had to pursue legal remedies against Lehrer and am still wound up in the legal process.  He has been found liable for unfair and deceptive trade practices in that lawsuit, but I still have not been compensated for my damages.
