We purchased tickets prior to online for the 11 AM Seneca Village tour. Our tour guide was José who was nice, professional, and very informative. It is located on the Central Park West side. We began the tour with Jose discussing and showcasing a map of Seneca Village. This map dated back to the 1800s which pointed out three church landmarks on an iPad. The three churches which were discussed included: All Angels Church, African Union Church, and AME Zion Church. It’s unfortunate that the city of New York claimed eminent domain on Seneca Village. Jose informed us that the blacks escaped racism from downtown society by creating and building their life in Seneca village. It was wonderful and inspiring to hear the story of these middle class blacks when Seneca Village was in its prime during the 1830s to 1840s. The citizens had various jobs including: cart mans, pullman porters, cooks, caretakers, farmers, and inn keepers. Unfortunately we were informed in 1857, the whole community was dissolved for Central Park to be built. As we already knew there was little to no financial compensation for having forced these people out of their homes. We learned about Andrew Williams who was one of the first residents of Seneca Village. Jose did state that there have been interviews of Andrew Williams’s descendants. William G. Wilson was another resident of Seneca Village. When an excavation on Seneca Village was performed, artifacts were found. This includes: a bone toothbrush, broken jars, glass, a fishing weight, and a curry comb. Jose informed us that Seneca Village residents did have stables for horses which they used to pull horse carriages. In addition to these residents being stable, they were also successful with disposable income to purchase luxury goods. Unfortunately we learned that by the 1840s, New York City was practicing predatory acts on Seneca Village. This includes building a huge land reservoir east of Seneca Village. In addition, the Irish community was also moving in. A key fact we learned was Epiphany Davis and  Andrew Williams founded Seneca Village.  We did also learn that the reservoir took four years to build, generated 180,000,000 gallons of freshwater, and all of this water was brought into New York City. What is now known as the Great Lawn was where the reservoir was held. A wonderful fact we also learned was Seneca village had women land owners including: Elizabeth Harding, Diana Harding, and Nancy Moore. Nancy Moore reportedly had one of the largest homes in Seneca village with three stories. Other facts we learned were that a lot of the homes had solid foundations built with rock and Manhattan schists. The residents used natural spring water from Tanner spring, since they couldn’t use water from the reservoir that was built. We ended the tour at Summit rock which is the highest point in Central Park. This location was a place of meditation for Seneca Village residents. Much is not known unfortunately about where the residents went once Seneca Village was destroyed. Jose did offer to give tour participants links of the Williams family interviews and photos that were shown on the tour. We greatly enjoyed this tour and our tour guide Jose went into great detail about the significance of Seneca village. The plaques were also very helpful and would be great to utilize for a self guided tour. Unfortunately we had to immerse ourselves mentally, since there is no real tangibles we could utilize to experience what Seneca Village was like. There’s very little research and resources that have been invested in Seneca Village. We hope in the future the city of New York will understand the importance of this village. It contributed to New York’s history and growth as a city for Black people. I would highly recommend the Seneca Village tour to everyone in New York City. This especially goes for Foundational Black Americans who want to understand how our history may be lost, but it cannot be erased."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We partook in this black centric activity on Thursday, August 11, 2022.
