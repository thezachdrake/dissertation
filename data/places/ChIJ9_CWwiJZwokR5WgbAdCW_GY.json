He thoroughly explains the diagnosis and the treatment plan.  He is not dismissive and answers each of your questions without rushing to get you out of the office.  Because of his way of practicing, I understand why the waiting time was a little longer than expected.  The wait was worth it because you leave his office with a feeling of tranquility.  He demonstrates empathy and seems extremely knowledgeable.  His staff is extremely friendly and his assistant is very professional.  I never had an issue getting in contact with anyone in the office and their patient portal seems to be updated promptly.  The office was clean and neat.  He ordered the required tests/labs immediately and makes you feel like he is \"on the ball\".  I recommend Dr. Geller for any patient that wants a doctor that makes them feel like a person and not like insurance bill statement.  If any negative reviews, I think it be because of the waiting - but due to the severity of the issue that Dr. Geller is handling with each patient; I thank him for taking his time with each one of us.  Therefore, for my next visit, I will go prepared to wait and know that I am going to be treated in the manner in which I feel that I deserve."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr. Geller is the type of doctor that takes his time.
