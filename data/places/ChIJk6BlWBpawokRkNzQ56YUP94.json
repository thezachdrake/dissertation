We chose this restaurant based off of the criteria of a location within walking distance of our hotel for the night as well as being a Michelin Star.\n\nWhen booking we noted that one of the guests was a pescatarian. We also left a note via email and when someone contacted us through text we also told them of the dietary restriction. Furthermore we called and left a voicemail because none of the other avenues seemed to be getting any reply back.\n\nWe arrived very early to find the location and walk around the area. One must walk past all of the gorgeous harbor views around the district and indoors to a large set of side doors leading into a bar like area that appears abandoned. We dined on a Saturday night on the 27 May so you might expect things to be buzzing in NYC. Walking forward past this odd area one can see a hallway that is lined with bookshelves hoisting pantry staples. On the left, you find the door to the restaurant. Walk further and you enter a food court like corridor. I think we were expecting a more warm and comfortable pathway to what is presented as an apartment-like restaurant experience. Nevertheless, we entered.\n\nWe received a sort of odd look when entering and that was a bit uncomfortable after the less than favorable transition into the establishment. We were asked if we had reservations and we were seated once we confirmed. To state that there was an odd palatable uncomfortable energy would be an understatement. Yet, we laughed it off and were ready for an experience.\n\nWhen we received an amuse-bouche, the server presented it as a welcome bite, as if we wouldn't understand the terminology. Immediately I asked if there was meat on the dish because I could see that there was and the service fumbled a bit. I kindly told them we made explicit requests for a pescatarian meal of one of the guests and they removed the dish. Calmly but eagerly the server approached the pass and whispered the mistake to the chef. Then without sort of apologizing but also sort of apologizing they tried to brush off the mistake and present the dish again. Very awkward and not the type of service one would expect from a meal that was $350+ a person and Michelin Star.\n\nOnce the courses started to come out I wanted to know more about some of the components. As someone who has worked in professional kitchens for 9 years, I am intrigued by my craft. This is where the night personally got ruined for me. I asked playfully about how the chefs composed a potato component and the server suggested that I state what I thought they did. I explained and I could see him sort of pause. Pause both by the actually culinary equipment names that I knew and by how close I was to understanding the technique. He then allowed us to enjoy the course and went back to the pass to mock me. Let me remind you that this place is very small. We were 2 out of 6 people dining at the time and close to the kitchen so we can hear the conversation. They laughed about it and even mentioned the movie \"The Menu\". Disgraceful.\n\nTo talk more about the food- we did enjoy most of the courses but there was some major downfalls. The amuse-bouche came with three components, one of which was a rehydrated and puffed pasta that was so chewie that it should never have been served. Trial or not. Maybe the humidity affected it or maybe the oil was too low when frying, either way it was a bumpy start to welcome guests.\n\nAlong the path of the other courses there was a vast amount of salt used, primarily in the scallop dish. The Sunny Ridge cheese course was not a favorable cheese and we both felt it was a bit of a harsh transition. On the other hand, the veal tartar or my tuna tartar course was likely our favorite. The olive oil used was exceptional and we appreciated the freshness of the dish overall. I do wish the white asparagus course was substituted with truffle or something else since my companion had foie gras."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We decided to celebrate a special occasion at L'Appart while on our way to Greece.
