We discovered that another contractor had constructed a waterproof membrane and that This Plumbing Company would have to cut through it in order to connect the new line. So that NYC Plumbing's pipe installation wouldn't void the waterproofing warranty, Mr. Mario was very kind and patient as I coordinated with the waterproofing business.
