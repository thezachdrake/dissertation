Camille and Diego are so caring, attentive, and quickly became good friends of ours. I always felt comfortable leaving Scooby for daycare while I was in the office as well as boarding him over countless weekends (we not so ideally had 8 weddings the summer we got Scooby). Camille and Diego also built such a great community among everyone who used Dogman Sachs. I gave a referral to someone I had never met who was hesitant about leaving his new dog with \"strangers\". He instantly felt the same way I did about Dogman Sachs and our dogs became best friends, who played together weekly. We used Dogman Sachs constantly and the price was unbeatable; however, my company then partnered with Rover so I was able to get dogcare for free (which I didn't take advantage of right away because I was devastated to part with Dogman Sachs). We moved from FiDi to Hoboken around the same time, and we have a great Rover walker who we love, but I still keep in touch with Camille and Diego and our dog Scooby adores their dog, Carnegie. I could go on and on, but Dogman Sachs is the BEST!
