Which has become exclusive because of redlining blockbusting real estate agencies. She was so intellectually curious about the area, because she realized it's a hidden gem that sells itself.

I was raised in Forest Hills Gardens after my father's death by my beautiful aunt who just recently died. And yet I'm unwelcome in my own neighborhood. One landlord even told me, I apologize we don't want people like you here. You're severely disabled and have no income. I have a traumatic brain subsidy, based on all of my years paying into social security. My guarantor is New York City with a AA rating. I'm such a judeo Christian, I cannot bring myself to put a lien against these landlords. They need to get super woke. This is a predominantly a Judeo-Christian neighborhood, founded by Dutch German Protestants. And yet they don't practice what they preach. That's why I continue to pray for them. Once moving back there I will put my youthful exuberance into bringing The Majesty of God back to the Gardens. I'm living with half a brain and yet I'm fully functional and intellectual. I embody God and am  proof that he exists. Never forget. Everyday he lives through me. And he fights all my battles. I'm just a conduit, and there are beautiful people there who feel his energy and it touches their lives. And they go out of their way to be obedient to the greatest story ever told. The Bible and mine. Thank you Cochran Realty from the bottom of my heart. You'll never understand how much you mean to me.
