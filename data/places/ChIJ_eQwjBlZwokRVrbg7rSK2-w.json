Also, the fact that you can get the equivalent of an hour & a half workout and be in & out of the studio in 30 minutes is truly only a bonus! The nutritional guidance, constant check ins, recipes emailed, even birthday/anniversary gifts given, are the little things that make this gym so very special.
