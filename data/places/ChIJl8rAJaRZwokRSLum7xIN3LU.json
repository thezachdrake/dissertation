I trained heavily—with a trainer—doing HIIT (high-intensity interval training) and a heavy weights program at least 4 times a week. I looked ok, felt ok, but was extremely frustrated that I wasn't getting the results I wanted given the amount of effort I was putting in. Different trainers over the years (I've had about 7 of them) gave me nutritional advice and none of it made much difference. I just resigned myself to it being genetics and, well, \"that's life.\"\n\nNow at 43 I decided one afternoon on a whim to search for a nutritionist in my area and stumbled on NYC Health and Nutrition. I read about the program, Irina's story, the work she does, and thought I'd give it a shot. The first meeting was right to the point. She listened to what my goals were and after a pause said, \"let me guess, you want to look this...\" and showed before and after pictures of some of her male clients. I said, \"if you can get me to look like that I will have every person I know at your door.\"\n\nShe delivered. I started with NYC Health & Nutrition about 6 months ago, and here's what's happened:\n\n• Total body fat has gone from 20% to 10%\n• Belly fat, from 24% to 9.4%\n• Visceral fat—the deep internal fat around organs—7.5 to 3\n• Muscle mass, from 155.4 to 186.9\n• Muscle quality, from 59 to 89.\n• Weight, from 204 to 192\n\nAnd at each of my weekly checkins the numbers just keep improving. I'm beyond thrilled with the results—looking and feeling better and better.\n\nMake no mistake though—this DOES take dedication and commitment. Have those two solid, and you will get results. No magic pill here. It's a lifestyle change, and Irina has been with me the whole way. She's got a direct, no-nonsense approach, but still manages to keep everything light and fun. Her commitment to my successes is inspiring—checking everything I eat via photos over text, commenting and making adjustments, and answering any questions I have. I know so much more about what to do and what not to do, and seeing the hard work in the gym finally bear fruit has been nothing short of amazing.\n\nSo I've kept up my end of the bargain—telling everyone who will listen about this fantastic person and program."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"13 years—that's how long it's been since I decided to get into the best shape possible.
