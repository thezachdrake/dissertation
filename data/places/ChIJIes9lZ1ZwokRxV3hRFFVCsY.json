Initially the menu makes the items look nearly appetizer size, but I’m telling you now, the portion size of each dish could easily be divided amongst 2 people. The flavor of the Kung Pao chicken is a smooth blend of minorly sweet, and spicy from the peppers they use. However the chicken bites are smaller with medium slices of bell pepper and red onion, as well as peanuts to bring a side aroma to the dish, I give the Kung POW chicken an EASY 10/10. The LoMein noodles are also lighter in flavor and very healthy, the noodles taste like they are made from scratch in house, which is my first experience with noodles in any Chinese restaurant I’ve been in. My wife gave the noodles a 10/10 since her flavor preference is more light than mine, I give them a 9/10 for taste and quality. Now there is 1 dish I Must give a 5/10, that is the steamed spare ribs with sticky rice. Although the ribs were fairly moist, the flavor was very bland, it didn’t seem like it was seasoned, and when it was steamed and covered in the rice, it was very messy. The rice took on the juices of the ribs which was very bland in my opinion, but the rice stand alone was done to perfection (when it Wasn’t in contact with the ribs juices. The corn was perfect though! 5/10. I would try the steamed dumplings instead the next time I go there.\n\nThe tea was A MAZ ING!!! I am telling you now, the floral aroma that brought me back to when I would eat the nectar off of honey suckles was very enlightening, I saw the LIGHT! I have never had fresh in aged tea leaves at ANY Asian restaurant apart from here, served in those $300 hammered iron kettles! No sugar was in it, nor was it needed! It was paired with an earthy bitterness that danced beautifully with the floral aroma.\n\nThe Service!!! To say the food came out fast (aside from the steamed ribs in sticky rice) would be a major understatement! The service people were very attentive each time we needed our water filled, and when we had empty plates! They told me which meal was the biggest in portion (which is why I tried the steam spare ribs) and they were right!\n\nThe fact that the Friday night life was vibrant in other places with LONG wait times?
