Perhaps the best part of this bar is their menu.  I've never in my life seen on any menu a 1945 Mouton Rothschild, which is what is known as a unicorn wine it is that rare and sought after.  Never thought I'd ever see that particular wine grace any menu.  The rest of their wine list is also pretty much amazing with everything from old vintage LaTours to Lafites, to Petrus, all of which do cost a pretty penny, so this watering hole is not for those with modest means.  They also have a stellar whiskey and cognac list, which is most impressive to say the least.  One truly rare bottle, the MaCallan 60 yr, Lailique is almost impossible to find today anywhere, but Rarities does boast a bottle in their epic collection.  If you are a wine or whiskey or cognac snob then you will love this place and I highly recommend stopping in for at least a glimpse of their extensive wine/whiskey/cognac list and perhaps a nightcap."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised when I happened upon this wine/whiskey bar.
