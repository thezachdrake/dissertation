We highly recommend the Pepper Oil but try just a little first so you can moderate to your correct heat threshold.  She had the Margherita pizza and loved it.  She said it was perfect \"fold over\" pizza.  She had the Prosciutto and Burrata special app which was huge and really tasty.  I had the Spaghetti with Cherry Tomatoes which was some of the best I have ever had and I have had a lot!!!  Really a must have.  We passed on dessert because we were too full, but 2 other tables told us the tiramisu was really good and really different than others they have had.  Great room and great service.
