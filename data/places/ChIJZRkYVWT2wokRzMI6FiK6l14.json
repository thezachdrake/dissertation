Instead of mindlessly aping tab, I’m gaining a feel for the sound and logic of the guitar itself. My ears and hands are getting to know the guitar and so gain skills for coaxing the sounds and songs I want out of it— and that’s why I wanted to take lessons in the first place. Besides the efficacy of his method, Justin is reliable and professional as a teacher, giving you his undivided attention as you learn together. If you’ve also been looking for a guitar teacher who not only has chops but is interested in helping you develop musically, I can’t recommend Justin highly enough."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Justin is exactly what I’ve been looking for in a guitar teacher: knowledgeable, patient, and attentive, with an approach that brings the guitar to life as an instrument.
