After signing up to see a psychotherapist at the Seleni Institute and being on a waitlist, the office manager wrote to me in early April to tell me that they could take me off the waitlist. She said that I would see one of their “clinicians,” Ramaa Reddy. At no point did Ms. Reddy ever mention that she was a student intern practicing psychotherapy as part of her studies. I was led to believe that Ms. Reddy was a licensed psychotherapist. During our sessions with Ms. Reddy made me uncomfortable. She pressured me to stop taking my antidepressants, she pressured me to use an online pharmacy named Hers, and she pressured me to change medications. In doing this, Ms. Reddy acted outside the scope of practice a licensed Mental Health Counselor and violated professional ethics.\nMs. Reddy did not comport herself as a professional psychotherapist. After several weeks of this behavior, I googled Ms. Reddy and was distressed to find nothing about experience in psychotherapy. A search of the Office of Professions’ database revealed that Ms. Reddy was not listed as having any type of license or permit authorizing her to practice psychotherapy.

I was very uncomfortable, but I explained the situation; she offered to pair me with a different therapist. However, I wanted to know whether Ms. Reddy had a license or not. To this, the office manager responded: “Of course, she has a license. Otherwise, that would be highly illegal.” I asked again for Ms. Reddy’s license number and NPI, and she said that she would email me the information.\nThe next day, the office manager wrote to me that Ms. Reddy did not have a license to practice, but that she did have a limited permit as a Mental Health Counselor. I consulted the State’s database again but did not find Ms. Reddy on the list of MHC limited-permit holders. When I told the office manager, she responded that Ms. Reddy did not have a limited permit, but was in fact, was a student enrolled in a Mental Health Counseling “bridge program” at Alfred University and was working at Seleni as a student intern under the supervision of Dr. Harteneck. I asked Seleni to provide documentation of Ms. Reddy’s enrollment in this program, and they said they would provide documentation via email. Seleni has provided no such documentation, although Alfred University confirmed that Ms. Reddy is a student there. Dr. Harteneck never contacted me to apologize or take responsibility for her student. Clearly, she did not supervise her student responsibly.
