The station is adjacent to Pennsylvania Station, the busiest railroad station in the United States as well as a major transfer point to Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, and the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nThis underground station was one of the 28 stations opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the initial segment of the Independent Subway System, at the time comprising what is now the IND Eighth Avenue Line from Chambers Street to 207th Street.\n\nThere are four tracks, two side platforms, and one island platform.
