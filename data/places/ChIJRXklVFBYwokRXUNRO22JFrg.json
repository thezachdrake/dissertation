A small retail store may not get volume pricing, but their prices would just be 10-15% higher, not 2 - 4 times higher. The bitters were actually labeled at $38.99 but she sold it to me for $25 to make me feel like I was getting a good deal and so I didn't check with my phone right there. Very slick! I have a feeling that maybe they file taxes based on the normal prices and pocket the difference? Maybe that's why they only take cash? Who knows but avoid this place. I gave it 2 stars and not one because at least it's the closest liquor store to where I live.
