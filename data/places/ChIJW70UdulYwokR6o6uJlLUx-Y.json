The wings, while large, were just doused in red hot sauce, leaving them soggy and way too vinegary. The nachos were huge and looked a bit better. Beer selection was average, but nothing special and slightly disappointing for NYC. The only non major brand offered was Lagunitas which isn't exactly a tiny craft shoppe these days. The others were all domestic staples that were not at all exciting. I guess it is supposed to be a traditional Irish pub which is supposed to allow for a rougher atmosphere, but I just found it slightly dirty and sticky.
