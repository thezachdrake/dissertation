Confused, the server asked what was going on, and when I told her she said that the bouncer has a short a temper and can “be like that” with customers.

I suggested to the manager that she look into training the bouncer better or hiring one who does not try to instigate problems with customers.  Later, some friends of mine told me they also had issues with this specific bouncer on previous occasions and had complained to management about it. It’s pretty crazy.

Doesn’t make much sense. My guess is the ownership knows and doesn’t care because I haven’t seen them acknowledge any bad reviews before. I’ve been coming to Blue Haven for many years but no longer.
