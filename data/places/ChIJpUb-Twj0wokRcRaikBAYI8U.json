Last week I went to buy 2 cans of cat food labeled .99 on the display and it turns out the price went up to $1.10. Spoke to the manager who said he would speak to the district manager about it. He did not give me the cat food at the labeled price but whatever. I go in this week and it is still labeled at the wrong price as though he can’t even make the decision to remove the outdated price. Then I download their app to get a promotional price clearly labeled for Post Fruity Pebbles cereals and that promotional price did not come up when they charged me. The manager did not even know what price it said on the display and went to see but still, their mistake but customer is the one that’s wrong. He said that’s a third party offer and they weren’t honoring it…. So why is there a display?!!! So frustrating to deal with them. It’s sad because it’s needed but this is very poor customer service.
