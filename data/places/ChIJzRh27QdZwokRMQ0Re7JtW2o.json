Syndrome (High Earner Not Rich Yet): Financial Strategies to Own Your Future”. I immediately thought, this is us!! We make good money, but why do I feel that we just aren’t getting ahead??\n\nSo I began to follow the author, Gideon Drucker. I signed up for his weekly emails and eventually attended one of his webinars. I was becoming hooked. Everything he was saying/teaching really resonated with me. I bought the book.\n\nIt’s not that my husband and I were a financial mess… we just weren’t very organized. We had not combined finances. We had numerous accounts between the two of us. We had no plan. We were kind of doing our own thing and I guess thinking it would work out in the end?\n\nMy husband needed a bit of convincing. Why should we pay someone to look at our finances, develop a plan, and then help us stick to the plan? We can just do that ourselves, for “free”. After some convincing, we eventually scheduled our Right Fit Call, which led to a follow up call, which led to working with Gideon and his team. The calls were awesome… everything that had resonated with me, resonated with my husband too. We were on our way!\n\nGideon and his team have been AMAZING. They are knowledgeable, incredibly helpful, and not judgy (I might have a slight shoe spending habit…). They are always around to answer our questions. We have saved a crazy percentage of our income in just the few months we have been working with them. We just were not getting there on our own. We have a plan, not just for finances, but also for insurance and for estate planning. We never realized how interconnected all these things are.\n\nHere are a few things we learned along the way:\n-\tWe wish we would have started earlier. Who doesn’t??\n-\tIt is not too late to start. We are not spring chickens, haha! It\nis amazing what we have accomplished in such a short time\nworking with Gideon and his team.\n-\tOur savings capacity is our greatest wealth building tool.\n-\tWe cannot emphasize enough the importance of having a\ncomprehensive plan.
