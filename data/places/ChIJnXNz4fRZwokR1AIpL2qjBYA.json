Justin introduced me to styles of singing that weren't really part of my performing style before like belting, crooning, and broadway and he worked with me from scratch.  He helped me select great music. He was patient and encouraging with me as he helped me develop my ear to differentiate between different vocal styles and qualities and to learn how to move between them.  Justin introduced me to more vocal exercises to help me think not just about my range, but about having a more consistent sound across my range and to continue good vocal quality into the higher end of my range.  Before working with Justin, I had not been thinking about these factors and now I work on them regularly.  The impact on my singing has been dramatic and has increased my enjoyment and appreciation of so much music.
