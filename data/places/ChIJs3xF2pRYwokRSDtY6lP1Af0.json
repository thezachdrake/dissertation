Two items of particular note in regard to Dutchman. When we launched our project Dutchman predicted an 11-12 month span. When construction was shut down by the pandemic for 3 months, the company began again as soon as they could, with an intact team and brought the project in in a total of 14 1/2 months, right on time minus COVID delay. Even more terrific, They have been incredibly attentive in the months since our move-in, tuning up and tweaking small issues as they’ve been noticed or arisen, as can be expected in any project of this scope. I can’t recommend them highly enough for their commitment to a first-class product."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"We bought an apartment in Manhattan in the spring of 2019.
