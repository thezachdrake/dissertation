The legal help I needed was filling an application for Green Card. The innocent immigrant that I was, I had no clue what's involved with applying for green card. The lawyer advised me their fee would be $3200 (this is year 2000 we are talking about here let’s not forget). I agreed. I came to their office and a paralegal filled up an application form for the fee of $3200.\n\nWhat a rip off... but wait! This is getting better: Apparently the fee didn't include the lawyer presence in the interview. It was just for 20 minutes filling up a form... When the interview came, 1.5 -2 years later (back then the time one had to wait was much longer than present day). I came with my wife and a baby. I was a legit applicant and I had no doubt in my mind that I would not pass the interview. Well, I failed. During the interview I was asked if I was arrested before to which I answered \"Yes\". On the application it stated \"NO\". That was the ground for the denial.\n\nAfter speaking to Carmon, and insisting on how no one asked me if I was arrested, since I know I would have answered \"Yes\", and how this is something the paralegal put on the application w/o asking me. I asked them to produce a letter stating this was a clerical error/ or something that was lost in translation. In return, I was accused of being a liar. Carmon would have to consult with her partner about that letter, and probably cost 2-3 hours fee.\n\nThis is when I understood all the lawyer jokes I didn't before. What a horrible experience. I felt I was dealing with a soulless person that has not a single fiber of integrity in her body. Sometimes you realize you made the mistake of dealing with the wrong person and you just must lick your wounds, cease contact, and move on.\n\nI ended up securing the services of another attorney with an office in the Empire State Building. For a mere $1000, he reapplied for me, and accompanied me to the interview. $1000!!! as opposed to the $3200 Carmon charged me for 20 minutes of paralegal services. This is how you take advantage from a young naive struggling immigrant.\n\nHorrible horrible horrible person!!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"8 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Back in 2000, this outfit was recommended by a top manager in the company I was employed by.
