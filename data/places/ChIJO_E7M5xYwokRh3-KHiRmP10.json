For years I went to her in my 20’s for an annual and birth control. Other reviewers are right- she is rough and fast and really doesn’t seem to care about your comfort. But she was close to me and I was in and out. Then I got pregnant, as I had wanted to. Her level of care was so sub-par and traumatizing! I was spotting so went in- she was out so I saw another, seemingly decent doctor. When I asked to switch to her, the new dr basically said no, that I was Langer’s patient. When I went back in and saw Langer, SHE COULDN'T FIND THE BABY ON THE SONOGRAM MACHINE. Like, umm, what? Langer then told me I was having a miscarriage and sent me to some radiology lab downtown to confirm. The technician at the lab found it right away and said I had not had miscarriage. I spent hours in that radiology waiting room in total anxiety and agony. I showed up at Langer’s office the next morning. I wanted another doctor. They refused, despite my telling them I was not getting proper medical treatment. They had me consult again with Langer. She told me that “we do not aid a failing pregnancy” and refused to give me progesterone. Umm, dear “doctor,” I’ve since learned that giving progesterone will not save a failing pregnancy, but will help one if that’s what it needs. I found a way better doctor who prescribed it for me, and is an honest, real, and capable doctor who knows how to use a sonogram machine and doesn’t misdiagnose! Stay away from Langer. There are so many doctors to choose from in this city. I’m so mad I stuck it out with her for as long as I did."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Dr. Hope Langer is a horrible doctor!
