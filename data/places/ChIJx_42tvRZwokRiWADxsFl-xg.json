Well that was October 2021. It’s now November 2022 and the construction is still going on! We have since moved out thank goodness, but men were right outside our window as in they could look into my apartment for hours at a time and on top of the lack of privacy the noise was insane. Their lack of transparency during the whole process was very upsetting. I have also come across a homeless man in the stairwell, the elevators are unreliable, and to top it off they’ll do nothing to rectify the situations. I even emailed management about said homeless man and received zero reply from them. The only redeeming quality about the building is the staff who were phenomenal which gives my review 2 stars. Needless to say save your money for elsewhere.
