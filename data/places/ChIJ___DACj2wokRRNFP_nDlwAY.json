The waitress was lacking sense of urgency and kept making mistakes throughout our dining experience (maybe she’s new), but the waitress that had the other tables was delivering orders even though a few came in after us. We ended up calling that waitress over a few times because she was on it. I ordered the French toast bites, egg and bacon then was told before my dish came out there was only Turkey bacon available. I was disappointed but opted for the substitute anyways. My turkey bacon was undercooked it tasted horrible. I told the waitress and she seem like she didn’t care and wasn’t even apologetic on behalf of the kitchen. The French toast bites was the only thing good on my plate. We had to keep asking our waitress and other workers for napkins and silverware which we wasn’t accommodated with from the beginning.
