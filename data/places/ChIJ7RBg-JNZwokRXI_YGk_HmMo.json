He recommended I start microneedling (a service that is provided by Tessa, who is also lovely!) over a year ago. The treatment has resulting in clearing up a scar I had on my cheekbone, and it improved the texture of my skin. I notice my pores are smaller, tighter skin and a reduction in fine lines. My complexion is better and more even toned. WV Plastic Surgery started offering a skin care line a little over a year ago and I have been using it since its inception. I really like the serums and creams that have become an intergral part of my skin care routine. I highly recommend the antiaging serum, hyaluronic acid serum, multi-correction cream and the sunblock powder. My favorite part is they have these products in travel size so it makes it really easy to stick to my skin routine while traveling.  I highly recommend West Village Plastic Surgery.
