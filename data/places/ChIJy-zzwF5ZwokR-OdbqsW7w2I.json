We went here during lunch and tried their dine-in thalis. Both masala Express and Chennai express thalis were delicious and you can't go wrong with your order. If you are craving rice and curries then I recommend the Chennai express thali and if you are craving dosas then try out the Masala express thali! The vegetable of the day for the Chennai express thali was beetroot poriyal. Along with that they served a lentil dish which in my opinion was a North Indian daal and should not be served in a south Indian thali. For anyone who is trying out south Indian cuisine for the first time, please do get the masala express thali so that you can try out an idli, a medium vada and a masala dosa! I highly recommend their Madras coffee too! If going for dinner do try out their pondicherry masala dosa or gunpowder masala dosa or cocktail fried idli. They give cash discounts so make sure to take cash if you want the discount. They also charge for a takeout container, so go there with an appetite so that you can finish the food :-D"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have been going to Adyar Ananda Bhavan since they opened their first location on 59th St and 1st avenue!
