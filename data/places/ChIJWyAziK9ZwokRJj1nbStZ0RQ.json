J'ai clairement dérangé tout le personnel, en 5 min j'ai 4 personnes qui sont venus me voir et aucune d'elle ne savait ou était rangé les articles, aucun conseil sur le maquillage, tout ça parce que Natasha Denona était là. J'ai gentiment demandé si il était possible de la voir on m'a répondu en levant les yeux au ciel, non c'est pas possible. En France ça ne ce serait pas passé comme ça, c'est beaucoup plus accessible. Franchement pour le service j'aurais du aller chez Sephora, en venant ici je m'attendais à un conseil particulier de la part des employés de la marque mais là ... aucun échantillon, aucun conseil, si vous voulez du maquillage Natasha Denona allez chez Sephora vous serez mieux servies !\n\nI went to the store yesterday it was the second time.
