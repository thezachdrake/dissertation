I request all egg donors to read this post completely and avoid this agency for donation. The good reviews on internet seems fraud and done by insiders. How can you expect someone to give 5 star rating without any text in the review, for some users this is first review indicating they just opened a new account to give good rating, you can review how to spot fraud posts on internet. They initially supplied a failed donor. All agencies first screen donors and then only accept successful as donors but this agency do not do that to cheat intending parents. The donor's AMH level is below 1. The fertility clinic in Columbus, OH told this is agency's fault to supply a failed donor, they should be held responsible. Then they supplied another donor in New Jersey, who was offshore at that time and never returned and they told she withdrew and we are close to 6 months but 6 months not completed, when I selected another donor, Dee Gulati in this agency said this donor is premium and asked me to pay 15000 dollars to secure her for donation. The contract with them did not specify the different fees for premium donors. This is fraud. Eventually I had to withdraw and abandon. They only returned 500 dollars, where as I lost thousands of dollars. The screening costs with initial donor and myself in Columbus, OH costed me 4000 dollars. This is cheating and robbing innocent intended parents.  I believe in educating prospective intending parents and take precautionary measures with the negative things happened to me with this agency."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This is the worst agency.
