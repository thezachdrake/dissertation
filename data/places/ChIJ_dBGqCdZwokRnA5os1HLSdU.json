I will definitely be back 😌"},"publishTime":"2023-11-11T02:28:11Z"}],"servesDessert":true,"dineIn":true,"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.728155780291495,"longitude":-74.0007041697085},"low":{"latitude":40.725457819708495,"longitude":-74.0034021302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":10,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":0,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":15,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":0,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":13,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":0,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":10,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":0,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":10,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":0,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":12,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"truncated":true,"hour":23,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":59}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":10,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":0,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 3:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Tuesday: 1:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM","Thursday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM","Friday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Saturday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM","Sunday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"135 Sullivan St, New York"}
