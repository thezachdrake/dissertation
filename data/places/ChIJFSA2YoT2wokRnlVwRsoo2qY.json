The receptionist (couldn’t get her name— purple scrubs, black hair in a pony tail, light/fair skin, clearly Hispanic based on her accent, with ZERO customer service skills) and the physician himself are all a joke. I am not sure how Dr. Henoch is a credentialed physician and I say this because I work for a private health care company, with high level credentialed physicians, who actually care about their patients.\n\nI accompanied my boyfriend’s father to an emergency appt on 4/28/2022 that was scheduled for him (by a nurse who went to see him at home) because his sugar/glucose levels were through the roof. Upon my arrival, I was not greeted nor welcomed. I approached the reception area and was instructed to add my name to a list and informed that the staff was out to lunch and would return in 10 min. I sat down and waited roughly 20 min to be called. After not being called I went to the receptionist and asked when we would be called, specially since she had originally informed us that the staff would return in 10 min. The receptionist answered with the following in Spanish “the staff will return whenever they feel like it” — “Ella va a regresar cuando se le pegue la gana”. I couldn’t believe her response and simply replied “wow, you shouldn’t be talking like that about your co-workers”. She also said “if you don’t change your tone with me, my co-worker will come out and lash out at you”. Again, this interaction was with the receptionist who is clearly underpaid and miserable while working there, and takes out her frustration on patients. This is completely unacceptable, unprofessional, and disrespectful.\n\nThere is only one person at this office who is polite— her name is Nicole. Nicole clearly doesn’t belong at this office environment, as she is the only one who is professional, attentive, patient, and kind. This is the type of individual who should be employed at a healthcare office.\n\nDr. Henoch is a joke— his skill is prescribing medication to patients and giving them the standard script “improve your eating and take your meds and you’ll live a long life.” I mentioned earlier that my bf’s father was scheduled for an emergency appt due to his sugar levels being through the roof. They took his vitals (height, weight, blood pressure, checked his sugar— which was still high), but no blood work was taken. What a joke and a waste of time.\n\nAnd to the receptionist who felt so comfortable being rude— you’re young, do yourself a favor and put in the effort to find a job where you can be/feel happy and project positive energy on to others. I would never recommend this doctor’s office to anyone. This office should not even be open to the public— it is clear that there is plenty of illegal activity happening here."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am Hispanic and I can say that this doctor’s office is a joke.
