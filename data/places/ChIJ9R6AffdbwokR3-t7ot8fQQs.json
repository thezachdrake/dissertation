However I responded in Cantonese. It was a very cold day so I was grateful that we were seated in a well heated table. There are 3 seating sections. We sat nearest the entrance. Single seating is in the middle while large groups are seated in the back of the restaurant. I ordered meals off the menu in Cantonese for both of us. Mine was perfect and hot! I was not happy with the vegetables served in my boy's meal. It was cheap boiled unseasoned cabbage rather than good choy sum. Iykyk! Service was good. There were tacky posters of dishes with advertisements for a delivery app at each table. From the customers we saw, this place serves mostly non Asian tourists. I would not return.
