Saying I couldn’t just exchange the pants after a couple years even though it had been less than 1. She then told me these pants are not made for working out. They are only for yoga. Which I’m a personal trainer and hot yoga instructor and have always used these pants for all my physical activity. If Lululemon leggings are not made for exercising or they will ripe what’s the point of advertising them as exercise pants. The employee called in someone else to look at the pants which he said the same thing but once he looked at the pants and saw the inseam was undone he said that was something they would absolutely honor. The female associate was not happy to switch them out. She put the pants down on the counter and then walked away. Another associate came and said “next customer” and I was asked if I was set to go. Absolutely unprofessional! I have been a loyal customer for years anytime I have had an issue it has been resolved.
