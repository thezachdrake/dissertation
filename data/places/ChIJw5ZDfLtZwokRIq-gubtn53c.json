They were so sweet and promptly brought us our food. We ordered the fried calamari & zucchini chips to start, chicken parmesano, chicken meatball dish, and truffle mac and cheese. We finished with the tiramisu, Cioccolatissimo, and Crème Brûlée. It's rare to find a place where every dish is enjoyable. The Crème Brûlée was my favorite. It was so smooth! Best tiramisu I've had in quite some time. The flavors and textures were well balanced. This is one of those rare places where every dish was exceptional and we didn't experience a long wait for anything. We also weren't bombarded with plates and overlapping dishes/courses. Every course had impeccable timing and was the perfect temperature. For instance, we just finished the last chip in the starter and table was cleared for the sizzling mac and cheese that we heard making it's way from the kitchen. I appreciate the attention to detail. In other restaurants, I hate waiting too long because I feel like I'm going to be there all night and I can't stand being rushed so staff can flip the table. They made us feel welcome but it seems they understood that we don't live there lol. My favorite part is being allowed to rest our food after this culinary experience! It wasn't difficult to ask for the check and they brought us our bags the moment we stood up without us asking. Reminds me of the quality of service I grew up with experiencing on Mulberry street in the 90s. Comfortable, delicious, genuinely warm/welcoming, and easy going but attentive. I didn't think I'd encounter the quality of service we received in this place. Not that I doubted them specifically! Lol. It's just so rare to have a pleasant experience from beginning to end. The décor definitely adds to that 90s NYC vibe but it's part of its charm. So that's a plus, for me. Nostalgic but not completely outdated.\n\nThe entire staff collaborated very well together to tend to every table. I was advised to reserve a table but I'm not sure we needed to because we dined early at 6pm. But the reservation didn't hurt. If you eat the way we did, be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you visit with a party of 4+ even if no one drinks. For the quality of food, I find it pretty affordable if your group just gets one dish each because times are hard. In this economy? Sometimes we have to make sacrifices lol. But if you can hack it, try as many dishes as you can possibly afford lol. Great wine selections, also!\n\nA huge thank you to the staff at Le Zie for making my mother's 69th birthday dinner a memorable one. I hope to be back soon for the Chicken Liver Pâté Crostini and Yellowfin Tuna Ravioli!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Warm décor, delicious food, and fabulous staff.
