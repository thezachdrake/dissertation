Just ask Rasha about his dog, and you’ll learn this is a very high bar! We also trust Rasha will always be there and be on time. He has been impeccably reliable over the nearly three years he has helped us with Cooper. He has never missed a walk, but he also picks up and drops off with clockwork precision. We also trust Rasha will be respectful as he comes and goes from our apartment and our building. I sit on the board of our building and know there can be occasional issues with dog walkers bringing packs of dogs in and out. Rasha is always thoughtful and we have never had any issues. Last but certainly not least, Rasha has earned Cooper's trust, which is not easily done. While Cooper the sweetest pup with us, he is a very anxious dog and wary of strangers. Rasha projects that calm positive energy that is so important in putting dogs at ease. Rasha is now one of a very small group of people that Cooper greets warmly. Moreover, when Rasha has added new dog walkers to his team, he has taken great care in slowly introducing them to Cooper.
