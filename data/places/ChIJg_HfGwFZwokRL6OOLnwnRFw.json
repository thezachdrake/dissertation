This shows me that customer service is not their number one priority which is disappointing because I thought I would really love this place.  I would only have had maybe 20 minutes of my full hour if I had kept the appointment and would have had to repurchase the massage if I rescheduled so I sadly opted to cancel the appointment entirely. While I understand the policy, I believe that there should have been some accommodations made considering the circumstances and considering I took responsibility in respecting them by calling ahead of time."},"publishTime":"2016-06-13T19:00:00Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7518494302915,"longitude":-73.97864596970848},"low":{"latitude":40.7491514697085,"longitude":-73.98134393029149}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":1,"hour":10,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":17,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":10,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":17,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":10,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":17,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":10,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":17,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":10,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":17,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":10,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":17,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":30}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM","Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM","Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM","Thursday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM","Friday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM","Saturday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM","Sunday: Closed"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"30 E 39th St Suite #1 Suite 1, New York"}
