Nice fella when spoken in person.\n\nManny in the Manhatton office, is a good lawyer except lately he doesn’t seem to remember his clients and also doesn’t return messages, he does his home work and is always on point when in court. Disappointed he doesn’t even reach out like before.\n\nWhat is frustrating about this firm is that the NYC receptionist need to be  replaced by more caring and kinder ones, when you call you get the vibe that they really don’t want to be bother or help you. Along with the lawyers informing us that we can call and they will call us back, when it’s a Illusion and a hoax’s.\n\nWhy hire a firm that doesn’t Cominicate correctly to there clients.  Unfortunately they started well with me back in 2013, but since then they have fallen and forgotten about many of there loyal clients, including me.\n\nOne has to take time from ones Schedule to drive pay $40 parking or get on the train and wait 2 hours to speak to them, when all they have to do is return a simple call....  this is for the Manhattan office."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"When it comes to speaking to your lawyers, they are not reliable, the receptionist claim they give the messages to the lawyers, but who knows.
