It was first called \"A House of Prayer\" and was started because the Episcopal churches at that time were not welcoming to the West Indian Community.

I remember that old red brick building very well as a very young boy. My mother, M.Edmead, knows the history well. She did a lot of research and wrote about it. The original red brick church building was destroyed by a fire in 1963 alleged to have been caused by a toppled candle.
