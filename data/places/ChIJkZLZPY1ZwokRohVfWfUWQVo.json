She also is familiar with many outside resources (books, podcasts, etc.) that helped me in my journey with depression.  Whenever I needed her support and encouragement, she was always available and willing to schedule a time to talk.  I highly recommend Matilda--she made me feel very comfortable as I discussed my concerns with her and she was very easy to open up to.  Matilda understands that life is not easy and many times we just need someone who really listens and cares to help us navigate through whatever it is we may be struggling with (family or friend issues, difficult relationships at home or work, or difficult life events, for example).  Additionally, Matilda is very open minded and supportive of the LGBTQ community, which I believe is very positive.  I also liked very much that her fees are extremely reasonable because I could not afford the higher fees that clinical therapists are charging.
