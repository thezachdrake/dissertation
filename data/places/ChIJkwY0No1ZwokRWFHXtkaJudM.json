My son has been with them going on his 3rd season and has become a much, much, much better player under their program. As a goalkeeper he has gotten excellent coaching from their staff, moving up the ranks of his age group. He began on their Development Team and has worked his way up to the Academy. He has gotten extra goalkeeper training from a variety of fantastic coaches. He has also been in their summer camp where the coaches have challenged him by having him play against older, more experienced players.\n\nThis has put my son in a position to succeed. While the teams, especially at the Academy level, demand hard work, that effort can and will be rewarded. He has become so accomplished that recently he was asked to tryout for the NYS Olympic Development Program and made the team. I dont think he would be in this position without DUSC.\n\nThe teams are really what your child makes of them. I won't lie and say that it is easy as there are multiple practices per week as well as having your family's weekends monopolized by constant games and tournaments but if your child wants to become a better player and is willing to put in the time both on and off the field then there is a clear path to success at DUSC.\n\nMy only complaint is that DUSC is a very large organization and sometimes their communication has been haphazard. That said I think the powers that be at DUSC saw the issue and have addressed it by using a new App for communications between the organization and families which has been much better.\n\nIn closing I recommend the organization if your child is serious about becoming a better player. If soccer is just one of many sporta your child likes to play then perhaps the Academy isnt for them. They also run an excellent recreational league on weekends which is perfect if your kid plays soccer seasonally but if they have higher aspirations then I think you should give DUSC a try and see how they measure up."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the club.
