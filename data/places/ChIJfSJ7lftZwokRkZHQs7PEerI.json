I'm experienced with pilates, lagree, etc., and this was not like any pilates or pilates-style class I've been to, in a bad way.\n\nTo start, the class was programmed horribly. The spring loads were weird on every exercise, either providing way too much resistance to prevent anyone from getting the benefit of the exercise, or way too little, making the exercise borderline dangerous from the moving carriage. The exercises were strange and not pilates at all, and the instructor was giving frequent breaks in between exercises--there were no smooth transitions or opportunities to stay in the work for any amount of time. We also did a lot of random arm exercises with dumbbells, that didn't really belong in pilates at all.\n\nThe instructor, Heather, had a great playlist. But, she didn't provide any cues for the actual exercises, didn't provide modifications, didn't even really describe what we were supposed to be doing on the machine. She would also get weirdly passive aggressive and angry if we didn't all jump into whatever exercise she said; which was usually because she hadn't actually said what exercise we were supposed to be doing (or if she did, no one could hear her in a room of like 25+ reformers and music blasting.) She was much more into dancing and yelling than she was providing instruction. I was genuinely worried that someone was going to hurt themselves because of how badly the class was programmed.\n\nFinally, she ended the class with like high knees and burpees, which was extremely high intensity without any real warm up, considering that the rest of the class had been more break than work. When someone in front of me said they weren't able to jump for the burpees, she still didn't give a modification. Also, we're all in socks...jumping and doing burpees on a concrete floor may not be accessible without proper shoes for some people, and certainly isn't what I'm expecting when going into a pilates class.\n\nThe room was huge and there are mirrors everywhere, which was fine, but the reformers also seemed super cheap and rickety. As far as pilates classes go, this was by far the worst I've ever been to. NYC has such a great pilates scene, definitely skip this place. Hopefully they'll fix the programming and provide better instruction in the future, but I definitely won't be going back."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Went to a Total class with Heather, and it was honestly the worst \"pilates\" class I have been to.
