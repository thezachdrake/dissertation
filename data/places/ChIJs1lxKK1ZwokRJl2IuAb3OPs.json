Everything is cooked perfectly and topped with guac and cotija cheese. Can't go wrong.\n\n(b) Bowl - lots of people opted for this. You only get one protein, but you get the rice, beans, guac, sour cream and apparently CHIPS in the bowl. This is a great option\n\n(c) Quesadilla/burrito - haven't tried these yet but this is the next frontier!\n\nAll in all, it's higher quality food than Chipotle, and you also don't feel like you're on some kind of assembly line.
