No one else I have ever been to spends the time he does to ensure every snip is perfect, or consults with their clients so closely along the way. Osamu is totally committed to his craft; he literally draws sketches of each haircut he does for you and keeps files on each client, referencing his notes from the last time and whether or not you liked the cut. Who does this anymore?! It's impossible to find someone more dedicated to perfection and the art of hair than Osamu. He creates beautiful layers, and whenever I get a cut from him even if I wait 6 months for the next cut my hair still feels great. On top of this, the atmosphere is great and he does not pressure you to come in every 6-8 weeks like many stylists do.
