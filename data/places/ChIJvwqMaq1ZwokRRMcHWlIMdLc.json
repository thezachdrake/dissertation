We were experiencing significant friction after having been married for 13 years. This was the first occasion in our lives when we reached out to work with a therapist. We had worked with another therapist before Anna, and we were still forming our list of requirements for a therapist. We realized that we needed someone who would be very frank with us, even while treating our situation with the care it needed. Anna spent a few sessions understanding our dynamics, personalities, history. And then we started working through the issues. Anna not only advised us and worked through our “issues”, she also shared literature that helped us understand the clinical background to things we were experiencing, and research on the same topics. For us, it was very useful to not just talk about our situation, but also understand that we were not unique. The materials were very revealing. There was no quiz later on. Toward the end of COVID, I decided to explore topics with Anna in personal sessions, and my wife and I were in a significantly better place. I have continued to work with Anna. I find her candor, combined with compassion, very refreshing. Personally, I don’t need someone to tell me that all the ways my issues manifest at my age, are ok. I want to find a way out, and I feel confident that Anna is the right partner for that. I deeply appreciate that her mindset is not for me to be in therapy indefinitely, because I certainly don’t want that. We don’t have a timeline of any kind, but there is certainly a feeling of pushing the ball forward. On basic hygiene factors: Anna is very well read, which comes across (not in an overly academic way, but she always connects her advice/observations to reading and research), always punctual, and prompt with communication. I try not to impose on her personal boundaries with scheduling, but she has always been flexible to accommodate me. Highly recommend working with Anna."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My wife and I began working with Anna during COVID.
