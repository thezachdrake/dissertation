Every other doctor I had gone to ignored my concerns and referred to the issue as non harmful and therefore not requiring treatment. If you are a brown person like myself, I HIGHLY reccomend her. She has done extensive study on patients of color, and knows the skin conditions that affect them more than the white population. On top of her knowledge, she has fantastic bedside manners, made me feel like I was just talking to a friend. She is bubbly, patient, and never makes you feel rushed out.
