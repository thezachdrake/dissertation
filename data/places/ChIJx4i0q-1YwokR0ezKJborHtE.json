I had my initial consult with Dr. Chu and it was the first time in 17 years that I felt heard and acknowledged. I left the appointment knowing that there was someone who cared about my pain and wanted to help. Just over a month ago I made the trip out to New York for excision surgery. Firstly, I want to comment on the team’s bedside manners. Arriving at the clinic, i was having severe anxiety about the internal ultrasound due to the extreme pain i knew it would bring. Claire, one of the nurses, immediately noticed the anxiety i was having and calmly talked to me about it. I cannot remember her name, but one of the office workers actually came in to calm me down and hold my hand through the ultrasound. Dr Seckin, who performed the ultrasound, was so gentle and kind, walking me through the entire process. I have never experienced such care and understanding and it’s something i will never forget. My husband and i were both blown away at the amount of support and encouragement i received. Waking up from surgery, i could instantly feel relief throughout my body. I am 28 years old, and i haven’t felt this good since i was around 10 years old. I just kept thinking “my body is at peace now”. Less than 24 hours after surgery i was up and walking around, feeling great. At my post op appointment, I had another internal ultrasound; this time with ZERO pain. I couldn’t believe it, and everyone was so excited for me. Im seven weeks post op as i write this, and life has never been better. I am finally able to live my life pain free. My life has changed in more ways than I can explain. It’s hard to put into words the way that Dr. Seckin, Dr. Chu and their entire team changed my life. I look forward to being a volunteer through Dr. Seckins endometriosis foundation to help bring awareness to this horrific disease. To everyone who was a part of my journey- thank you for giving me my life back. I cannot recommend Dr. Seckin and Dr. Chu enough.
