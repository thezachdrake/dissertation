The clients are pleasant and sweet however they often act out due to lack of support and care. The DSS Lisa Stone has been there screwing up everything and they refuse to get rid of her, which is baffling because she didn't even pass her initial interview. She ran the entire previous Social Services team away and was alone for months not doing anything for the clients rather than judging them and blinking stupidly. You ask her a question and she just sits there blinking. Always busy but nothing is complete nor accurate. She's racist towards the Spanish clients and often refuses metrocards, holding them tightly for the ones she favor which is crazy because NONE OF THE CLIENTS LIKE HER. They will work with ANYONE BUT HER! They were almost fully staffed and lost two workers in a week. There is no structure or support there. The program Director Tamara Bryant just worried about looking good, getting her BBL, and making her \"6 figures\". Always kee kee-ing with staff about the DSS but turn a blind eye and side with her when anything is bought to her attention. They have no HR department and the program Director and admin does all the paper work and payroll stuff. They have an executive whatever named Maxine Wu, that just smiles and ask hows everything going (she has no idea what the job is about) because no one ever stays and they always leave because of Lisa Stone. I was there for 2 months and never received any training because I knew more about the job than the person supervising me, Lisa Stone. I intimidated her with my dedication, grit, tenacity, and honed ability to get the job done, which shone light on the fact that she has been winging her position from the start. She's a very wicked woman and karma is heading her way and fast. GDH and New York Foundation for Senior Citizens is just the founder, Linda Hoffman's, tax write off. The furniture is so old, wooden and infested with roaches. The colors in the building are blank and depressing but long as Linda stale face likes it, nothing gets updated. No one cares about the residents or employees. There's a new Case Manager new to shelter who I trained and taught because the DSS is overtly incompetent at the job and eveyone sees it. How are you at a place and NOONE has anything nice to say about you. I was dealing with one of Stones clients this week who nearly cut off my circulation to my wrist when I turned to get Ms. Stone so she could help him. He worked with me and another CM instead because she's that horrible. Another client who no one ever seen needed a residency letter and almost ran away when he was sent to meet with Ms. Stone, and nobody acknowledges that she is the problem. One client got lost for the 3rd time this week because she forbade the housing specialist from going with him, which is HIS job. She jeopardizes the clients housing opportunities, integrity and even their health. She allowed one elderly man to sit in the lobby waiting hours for his insulin to be administered and he ended up in the hospital 3 days in a row. Not to mention he had returned from the hospital the day prior. You get to do whatever you want there. Just on tuesday and elderly man who suffered two strokes broke down crying because he was able to bathe and smelled horrid as a result. The lower staff came up with an initiative to keep a high risk tracker for those who need more support. Another man went missing earlier this week and the CM and admin had to physically go out themselves and look for him and no one batted an eye. That shelter produces the bare minimum for state mandates and is the only reason the doors are still opened. This place is traumatizing to both the clients and staff. If you care about you mental well being, then DONT EVER WORK THERE! If you just looking for a check then this is the place for you."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a week ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Horrible place to work.
