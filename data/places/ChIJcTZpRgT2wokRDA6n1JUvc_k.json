The lady that did my nails was absolutely a sweet heart with my toddler and I, but most definitely needs more experience and training. I asked for a short petite squared acrylic set with gel Polish… I left with nails that looked like “duck nails”, streak marks on ALL ten fingers due to thick layers ofpolish being applied, uneven lengths, some nails were slanted, the acrylic application was way too thick for the length I asked for and her technique in ratio monomer to acrylic applying was way off. The cuticle bead wasn’t applied as close as it should’ve been or could’ve been, along with the Polish. I left with a fresh set that looked like I already needed a fill in & my nails were definitely bulky. All in all, the lady that did my nails was nice but needs more experience and practice for sure. As far as the rest of the staff they need more hospitality in their bones, I mean I didn’t get a greet until my 5 YEAR OLD and I said hi. I didn’t get asked what I wanted, I had to say it myself.
