I got the day and time that worked best for me and was cheerfully greeted when I walked in the door!  She was easy to talk to, and clearly has experience, as the style she gave me was easy and fits with my lifestyle.  The color she chose for my hair complemented my skin tone very well and was very high quality (it covered the grays very nicely!)  What surprised me the most was that I truly felt like I was the center of the universe the entire time I was in her chair.  Never once was she distracted, or took her focus off of me.
