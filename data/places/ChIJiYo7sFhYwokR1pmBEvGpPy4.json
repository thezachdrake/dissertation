One of those questions was: \"how long did you do Pilates?\" That's when I knew this man was in a category of his own - I had not mentioned in conversation or anywhere on my intake form that I had been a Pilates teacher for 20 years (though haven't practiced consistently for more than 10 years), and yet, he could see/hear/feel it in my musculature - without any words from me.\n\nMy healing has been slow, the \"three steps forward, two steps back\" kind of slow, but I am finally feeling like I am really truly healing thanks to consistently working with Dr. Tatz. I'm reminded in our work together how complex the body is, how everything in the body is interconnected, and that there are no absolute \"rules\" about pain or healing.
