The basic navy/black/tan are the ones I wear to work and the fun colors/prints I wear on a night out. I’ve been buying Rivieras at Bloomingdales before this store opened and am elated that the store opened in such a convenient location as there’s a much wider variety here, including the super adorable kids collection.

Perfect for taking long walks outside to escape the doldrums of quarantine life. The shoes are excellent quality and you can tell they will last many seasons, but even if you want to switch them out regularly, buying a couple pairs won’t break the bank. Tested my beige suede ones out during a long and grueling moving process and happy to report  they held up well, didn’t scuff or get dirty. Also took a 5+ mile walk with no issues and not a single blister in sight. Definitely going to get more in the suede leather and hope they’ll make more colors in that style.
