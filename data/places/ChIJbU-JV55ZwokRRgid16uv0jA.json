My best friend was speechless and stunned. I was dumbfounded that she caused a scene in the 1st place. We both literally had a great time up until that happened. Needless to say, this will be our 1st and last time going there. Terrible demeanor and service that left a really poor taste in our mouths given that we're both established people in our late 30's born and raised in NYC. This situation was very insult to both of us. It almost feels like native New Yorkers are nnot appreciated and welcomed here.
