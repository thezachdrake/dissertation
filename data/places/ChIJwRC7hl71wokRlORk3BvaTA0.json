My favorite was definitely the Rasta pasta. I would definitely recommend this because it was the right level of spicy and creamy. The portion size is huge so much that we ended up having to share it. The lobster mac & cheese and fried shrimp were also pretty good. For drinks, I would recommend the rum punch and the margarita. If you like a strong margarita on the rocks, this is the right choice for you. You can choose different flavors like passionfruit and mango. You can also request for the drinks to not be super strong and it'll still taste good. The music is on point and the waiters were attentive and helpful.
