Kwok Sifu is a direct student of GM Wan Kam Leung of Hong Kong. I have been a member of the school for about 8 years and feel myself very fortunate indeed to have found it. It is a fabulous place to learn Kung Fu, to develop your mind and body, experience a bit of Chinese culture, met new people and make new friends, and learn how the lessons of Kung Fu translate to life. It is located in the heart of one of the most vibrant cities in the world. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, steeped in traditional martial art culture, and yet quite modern in its philosophy and approach. The school is open 6 days/week, visitors are welcome (call first for current pandemic related rules), accepts students of all ages, no prior martial arts experience is required, offers a trial lesson, and has an amazing group of students, instructors, and disciples who are happy to share their knowledge with you. If you are in town, or in the neighborhood, I highly recommend a visit. I love this place!!
