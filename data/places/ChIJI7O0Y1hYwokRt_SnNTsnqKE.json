The bread was crunchy and soft at the same time.\n\nShepherd Salad- It was delicious.  We got the large- it looked \"small\" but it ended up feeding 5 (one less than enthusiatic child) people as an appetizer pretty comfortably.

We are more familiar with this- as it is similiar- but not the same as Gyro meat.  The spices were on target and it was a fantastic dish.\n\nLamb Adana Kebab- Honestly, our family is not used to eating lamb.  HOWEVER, we \"went outside our comfort zone\" for this- and boy was it great.  It was not to gamey for us.  There were great spices in this dish, and everyone at the table went back for seconds.\n\nStuffed Cabbage Leaves (Lahana Sarmasi)- It was not your usual \"stuffed cabbage\" filling.  It was flavorful, the sauce was delightful, and nothing was left when we finished our meal.\n\nThis is a \"returnable\" restaurant.  Really.  The meal was plenty for 5 people.
