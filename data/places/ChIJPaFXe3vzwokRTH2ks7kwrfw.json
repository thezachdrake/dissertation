I had the SAME issue with a different manager here again on 7/21/23 (she refused to give her name but the operator number is 6189it). Luckily she realized I knew what I was talking about and accepted the return after a few minutes of back-and-forth. I made another formal report through customer service so hopefully this store will eventually get the memo!\n\nThis location is discriminatory towards plus-size people! Before making my online purchase, I confirmed that I would be able to return items to my local rainbow store. The order invoice specifically states: \"We gladly accept returns to any of our 1000+ Rainbow Stores for FREE.\"\n\nWhen I received the shipment, 7 items were either too small or too big. Thus, I made an additional online purchase of $72 to order the correct sizes, and headed to this rainbow location to process a return for the items I no longer needed. After arriving to this store and waiting on a long line to reach the cash register (there was only a male individual processing purchases/returns up front. A female employee was also at the registers observing for training purposes.\n\nWhen I reached the register, I told the male that I had an online return.  He then proceeded to tell me that I could not return the items to the store because they do not carry plus size. The female employee assisted in translating (the male employee was predominantly Spanish--speaking). The female also informed me that the male was her manager. Even though I showed them both the invoice return policy, they continued to refuse my return. At this point, the line behind me was growing and the situation was becoming a complete spectacle. I asked the male and female employees to provide me with a number for Rainbow corporate office but they told me to call customer service. I stepped to the side to allow customers behind me to complete their transactions while I called the customer service number listed on the invoice.\n\nI spoke with a customer service representative (Brianna), who stated that the store could not deny my return because Rainbow policy allows online returns, regardless of size, to be processed at ANY Rainbow location. I even placed her on speakerphone so that she could direct the employees to process my return. Yet, they continued to deny my return, repeating loudly \"We don't sell plus size!\"\n\nThe manager (Who I later learned is named Phillipe, Operator number 8954FC) then began calling other individuals on his cell phone to discuss the matter. Once off the phone, he began ignoring me and continued taking other customers from the line. When I asked what we were waiting on to complete the return, the manager continued to ignore me. I informed the customer service representative that the store was still denying my return, and she stated that she would locate a Spanish-speaking  representative to call the store and speak with the manager directly. When the Spanish-speaking representative called, the manager continued to let the phone ring even after I informed him that it was customer service calling.\n\nAfter I insisted, the manager answered the phone and spoke to the representative. He then shook his head and proceeded to process my return. This entire ordeal took over 20 minutes and was COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. As a manager, Phillipe should have known his company policy. It should not have mattered what size my items were or whether the store carries plus-size. Although I understand that the female employee was following orders from her manager, I also take issue with this kind of blind obedience. WRONG IS WRONG. I appreciate the support of the customer service representatives who assisted, but I can't help but wonder how many other customers have been turned away from this location due to the staff creating their own BIASED policies. I will never spend a dime at this location and I will be moving forward with filing formal complaints, contacting corporate, and potentially seeking legal advice regarding this experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"**Update**- Two years later and this location has still not learned their own return policy.
