During my delivery being I had a scheduled C-section she was there making sure I was completely comfortable the whole entire time! I mean while I received my spinal she was the one holding me not the nurse! Yes she is the best!!!!.Once she started the C-section my baby was out in less than 20mins I also had my tubes tided i was completely done in the Operating room in less then 30mins seriously. My recovery was great and she made sure I had everything I needed. The ladies in the office also the best they literally made me feel like family every time I went in.
