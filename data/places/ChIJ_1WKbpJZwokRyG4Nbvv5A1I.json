The product line is updated regularly so you can always find something new and interesting as well as an old favorite.\n\nThe prices are on the premium side but worth it.  The frames are unique and beautiful.  It is unlikely that you will run across your frame on someone else.\n\nThe staff are superior professionals who know their craft and understand eyewear and it's relation to the face.  They will guide you toward frames that suit you best and even toward something you may not have initially chosen.  They aren't just trying to sell you.\n\nThere is no doctor on sight but they can refer you to one close by.  They are also quite fanatical about the accuracy of the fit and how the prescription is filled.  They really stand behind their product.\n\nI have purchased probably 6 or more frames from Surreal over the past few years and this is my Go To spot for my eyewear.
