I am speaking from the point of view of a person working in the medical field.\n\nDr Ngai is straightforward and may come off as blunt. She doesn't sugarcoat what she has to tell you. To me she doesn't come off as being rude. I like this approach as I would rather be told information as it is. I could see maybe the delivery of info needs to be done with more sensitivity, but it doesn't bother me.\n\nDr Ngai does pelvic transvaginal ultrasounds directly in her office during the visits (whereas my previous GYN did not do ultrasounds in the office). This is a big plus. Because of this, she is able to monitor things firsthand, and detect things early before they start problems. For this, I am very THANKFUL to Dr Ngai for caring for my family member. Apparently, there are no recommendations for screening tests for certain GYN cancers, but Dr Ngai's routine exam was literally life-saving. Her diligence and expertise makes a world of a difference. She took the time to explain everything in detail, and went over what to anticipate and expect, including what the next steps in care would be.\n\nI have tremendous respect and appreciation for Dr Ngai!
