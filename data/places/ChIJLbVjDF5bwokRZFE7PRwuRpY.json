Chef Ed Tinoco and Chef Marcus Samuelson have truly put together a masterful menu that is certainly to any palate.\n\nAnother big shout out to the entire beverage team. Their wine list is extremely sophisticated and worldly. Some incredible selections at perfect price points from all over the world! More countries are represented than I have seen on a list in a long time. Their cocktail list is uniquely special, and you can tell how hand crafted the beverages have been created. They even have an insane non-alcoholic specialty drink list for those who still want to try something new.\n\nAs for food, I wish I could try the entire menu. My guest had the Montauk Fluke Crudo, which was stunning to look at as they truly enjoyed it. I myself had the Smoked Hamachi Taco, which was out of this world. (See video) The house made belini-tacos infused with basil oil were the perfect vessels for the Hamachi. It perfectly wrapped the fish as I made my taco table side. Truly creates a perfect bite. Sweet, salty, crunchy, savory, and Umami. BRAVO!!!\n\nFor entrée, my guest had the Arctic Char with an uni beurre blanc, and I couldn't decide because I wanted EVERYTHING.... I closed my eyes and blindly pointed to the duck.\nMy guest was overjoyed with the luxuriously delicate flavors of the sea. I mean... come on, people... what's not to love when an UNI BEURRE BLANC is involved.\nWhen my dish arrived, I took a second to appreciate the time spent perfecting this dish. The duck was exquisitely cooked. The knife cut through it like butter as the perfectly crispy skin cracked within each succulent bite. I haven't even gotten into the Molé, or even the side of duck confit!!! Take me to flavor town! And if you thought that was it, think again, because this dish wouldn't be complete in its decadence without a nice piece of foie Gras..... and game over! Please send me home with a side of that molé sauce so I can bathe in it! A Homerun of a dish in my book.\n\nFor dessert,  my guest and I shared their bacon caramel flan....\n\nYes....\n\nThat's right.\n\nA Bacon caramel Flan!\n\nDo I even need to explain any more???\nGo to Metropolis NOW and try it for yourself!\n\n@ericjordan03oninstagram"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Love love love this place.
