I've never EVER heard of that and spoke with several other doctors who said the same. Another reason I stopped seeing him before- he spends the first 15 minutes of your appointment looking at notes from the previous session which should absolutely be taken care of ahead of time. Also, he only takes cash for an appointment, no credit card which I've never heard of for a doctor before or since either. My advice to anyone considering him is to stay away. There are better, less sketchy doctors out there would will be more consultative and compassionate as well."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Stay away!
