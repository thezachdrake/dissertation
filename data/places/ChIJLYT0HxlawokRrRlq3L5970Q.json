She is 58 years old and the last 11 months have been a whirlwind of emotions and stress. She originally had emblem health insurance and they were great. My family and I decided that it would be best if I become my mother's aid through CDPAP. There are a lot of agencies and information over load out there about these programs that can be very overwhelming when you have no idea what you are doing, and at the same time dealing with a life changing event. It's like we lost our mother sort to say because she will never be the same person ever again. But that's life, we just deal with the punches, right.\nWe did all the necessary steps to get CDPAP, and had to change insurance. I picked health first because this is the insurance my older aunts have and they were satisfied with the services they are receiving. I learned the hard way that insurances aren't tailored to your needs. They advised me that she was eligible for this long term care plan, senior health partners through health first. They offered all the things my mom needed so to me this was a good choice. Or so I thought. Again these phone calls are very overwhelming if you do not know what you are doing. I would be on the phone for hours.\n\nMy mother needs more hours with an aid for the weekend (I do CDPAP during the week) and Pt, OC and speech therapy, yet they have completely ignored my mother's doctor's and therapist's recommendation for additional services. The requests get denied without conducting a new assessment.\n\nYesterday they called my mother out of the blue to schedule a nurse assessment while I wasn't there, mind you they have my information and the case worker Milady Matos, use to call quite often in the beginning, but has ghosted us the last couple weeks since we been requesting additional services my mother clearly needs.\nThey schedule the call for today from  2-3 pm. We were supposed to receive a link for a telehealth assessment with a nurse, but we have yet to receive one. So I call them concerned and no one had any information about this VC. Every time they transferred us to a different department during that same call, they had to speak to my mom to verify her information, even though I have filled out the form to make myself an authorized person. The last rep they transferred us to hung up on us.\n\nThis insurance company should be closed down. If you are looking into long term care programs through Medicaid for yourself or your family member, do not choose health first/ senior health partners. Steer clear from these people who will frustrate you and stress you out until you eventually want to give up. DON'T GIVE UP! change your insurance ASAP.
