My fiancé settled on Kaylee after many unfortunate circumstances and change of location with Covid-19. Kaylee reached out via Thumbtack claiming that she was a good fit for a surprise proposal. Her photos looked amateur, so my fiancé didn’t respond until his other photographer stole the deposit and deleted his account. With 50mph winds on the beach, our location got moved into a suite at our hotel where Kaylee was to stay hidden to capture the moment.\nWe had a video playing pictures from over the years with the proposal at the end and a GoPro hidden on the TV to capture my raw reactions. Kaylee was requested numerous times to stay hidden because my fiancé knew I wouldn’t act genuine if I knew she was there. Kaylee flashed and clicked her camera 4-5 feet away from me for 15 minutes!! I was just sitting in the same position watching a TV so one photo could have been sufficient. The GoPro footage shows a constant flash and click from the camera and she proceeded to walk around behind me and was in the recorded footage. Kaylee “hired” an assistant to help her. His footage was just as terrible and showed Kaylee walking all around in it. Neither one of them were inconspicuous and they made me feel the most uncomfortable I have ever felt.\nDuring the actual proposal, Kaylee got my fiancé on one knee, but my hair was in my face and she didn’t show the ring. At this point I already knew she was there so she should have moved around to get the right angle. You could tell she didn’t have any experience and doesn’t have the eye for photography. She asked us to go to a different beach the next morning and bring ideas for photos because she felt bad about the hurricane winds. The night of our proposal, Kaylee text my fiancé and asked for us to leave good reviews before we had any of the pictures back.\nWe saw one sneak peek the next morning and were nervous we would waste time on more photos, but with wishful thinking we went. Afterall this is supposed to be the best moment of our lives and we wanted it to be captured to look back on. We decided to not look at the camera because we knew Kaylee’s style was just to pose and look at the camera and she kept repeating “look at me, look over here.” Luckily my fiancé flew my best friend in to celebrate with us and she snapped photos on her iPhone that turned out better than a hired photographer’s. Every photo we showed Kaylee from Pinterest, she had an excuse why she couldn’t do it. I feel like Kaylee just started photography and needed us to use in her portfolio. While she has 4 pictures of us smiling at the camera, none of them are in the moment or look like engagement photos. One picture my arm is blurred and another with my eyes closed!! I kept having to get my hair out of my face and she said she would edit the hair out of my face, but she didn’t!\nIt’s not even about the pictures, but because she was in my face snapping photos during the most intimate moment of my life, I just stood there. My fiancé forgot what all he was going to say. She RUINED what was supposed to be the best day of my life. After two days spent taking photos and not enjoying vacation, we do not have one professional photo that shows me, my fiancé, and the ring. The ring was the whole reason she was hired, and she missed the one important picture. Every time I look at the photos she took I cry thinking of how bad that experience was. If you have an important event DO. NOT. USE. Kaylee Bird Works. You will regret it.\nMy fiancé had to pay for Photoshop and learn to edit the pictures that he paid Kaylee to take."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Kaylee Bird Works photography was the worst experience of my entire life and it was my PROPOSAL!
