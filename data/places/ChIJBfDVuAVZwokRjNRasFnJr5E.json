They use quality steak that is very juicy and full of flavor. Then they add chimichurri and tahini sauce to the sandwich but you never lose the flavor of the meat.  I would drive into the city just for this sandwich alone. My second favorite is the Havana Cuba which comes loaded with pernil and jamon.  I've had many Cuban sandwiches but this one tops them all.  Here, they get your order out fast! They get large orders so I suggest to order ahead.  They also have a good tasting chai tea and coffee.  The breakfast sandwich was also good and the pancho villa.
