We came to pick it up the night before the wedding and hung it up in a safe place once we arrived to jersey. The morning of the wedding, I open the gown and am HORRIFIED to see my dress had been completely ruined. The material of the dress looked like it was scrapped on concrete or something.

Once I got into the city the literal first thing I did was go to the store and bring the dress with me. I was hit with backlash and was told that I must have been the one to ruin the dress because it was not like this when given to me (i literally took the dress out of its PLASTIC to put it on). After going back and fourth for a few days they finally told me to leave the dress at the store and they would do what ever they could to fix the dress but to give them time because the “season was busy”. I received my dress yesterday and almost died. They had completely replaced the front material with a cheaper not even the same color material and completely destroyed the style of the dress. Unfortunately this is going to be in my memory forever because I had to wear this dress to my ONLY sisters wedding. Disappointed is an understatement. Ive been told they would speak to the owner for a partial refund but have yet to be contacted. I hope this is able to help anyone else out there looking to bring their clothes somewhere. This was truly a nightmare and unfortunately will never be forgotten due to the occasion. Oh and to add a cherry on top of the Sunday they were also extremely racist to my boyfriend who is Asian.
