Book her immediately.\n\nFor everyone else, I'll try to be as thorough, yet not too exhaustive in this review.\n\nMy wife and I hired Jenny Fu as our engagement and wedding photographer. Jenny was the easiest vendor to book because we had total confidence in her abilities. We looked online and saw her website, and we liked that she has an emphasis on editorial photography. After a couple of calls and the exchange of a few emails, we planned to meet in San Francisco for our engagement shoot and again in Houston for our wedding.\n\nProfessionalism: Jenny is very prompt with her messaging and professional overall. There is so much to plan when planning for a wedding, and Jenny made it as easy as possible. She asked us for what we envisioned and offered suggestions we never would have thought of. Everything from that point on went incredibly smoothly. An example of this would be her preparation prior to our engagement sessions. Jenny did plenty of research and mapped out 3 amazing places for us to have our pictures taken, and they all turned out beautifully. She also has a very warm and welcoming personality. We've been told from our friends and family that they love her because of how engaging and fun she made the photo sessions at the wedding. My sister and her fiance have even booked Jenny as her wedding photographer as well because she did such a great job!\n\nWorking with Jenny: Engagement and wedding pictures are not your average pictures. The poses, different angles, etc. were intense at first, but Jenny makes that whole process a breeze. She is always laughing and having fun, and as a result, definitely put us at ease. The turnaround time for the engagement and wedding photos were very quick considering how much work is required afterwards. We were so surprised how much time she puts in to her work to ensure that not only they look great, but also they come back in a timely manner. On top of all that, Jenny kept us in the loop with the progress of the photos every step of the way.\n\nQuality of Work: As seen in her portfolio, she does an amazing job with pulling out the colors, which are more dramatic and beautiful. The angles of shots and different types of ideas she had were great, and we were completely blown away from how she captured every special moment shared between us. Jenny is incredibly thorough when it comes to planning, and she knew exactly what we wanted after showing her a few sample pictures.\n\nThanks again for everything, Jenny!

The turnaround time for the engagement and wedding photos were very quick considering how much work is required afterwards. We were so surprised how much time she puts in to her work to ensure that not only they look great, but also they come back in a timely manner. On top of all that, Jenny kept us in the loop with the progress of the photos every step of the way.\n\nQuality of Work: As seen in her portfolio, she does an amazing job with pulling out the colors, which are more dramatic and beautiful. The angles of shots and different types of ideas she had were great, and we were completely blown away from how she captured every special moment shared between us. Jenny is incredibly thorough when it comes to planning, and she knew exactly what we wanted after showing her a few sample pictures.\n\nThanks again for everything, Jenny! You truly captured the love we share for each other and can't thank you enough!"},"publishTime":"2018-02-21T18:53:04Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7149148302915,"longitude":-73.98004351970849},"low":{"latitude":40.7122168697085,"longitude":-73.9827414802915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":6,"truncated":true,"hour":0,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"truncated":true,"hour":23,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":59}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: Open 24 hours","Tuesday: Open 24 hours","Wednesday: Open 24 hours","Thursday: Open 24 hours","Friday: Open 24 hours","Saturday: Open 24 hours","Sunday: Open 24 hours"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"Madison St, New York"}
