We wanted a NY bagel - and this was the perfect place! The bagels were fresh and the lox spread was delicious. The owner was friendly and made it a point to greet everybody that was there. While there wasn't much of a line when we arrived (around 11:30AM), there was certainly one when we left! We sat next to one of the \"regulars\" in the small dining area and enjoyed the conversation. A great experience for sure!"},"publishTime":"2023-11-04T22:34:39Z"}],"dineIn":true,"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.7601385302915,"longitude":-73.9641837697085},"low":{"latitude":40.7574405697085,"longitude":-73.9668817302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":7,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":18,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":7,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":18,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":7,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":18,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":7,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":18,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":7,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":18,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":7,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":18,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":7,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":18,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Tuesday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Wednesday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Thursday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Friday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Saturday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Sunday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"1070 2nd Ave, New York"}
