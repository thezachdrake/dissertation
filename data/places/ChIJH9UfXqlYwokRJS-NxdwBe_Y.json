I am currently a 8th grader- definitely excited to graduate and the good side is that they offer the regents.

During transition (class transition) it is veryyy packed with people. Also another issue that comes up is the schools equipments. sometimes the air conditioner wouldnt work and it veryyyy hot in the classroom or the heater occassionally dosent work. I mean, you cant blame them it is indeed a very old building. we dont even have a elevator just stairs. but the positive sides is that you make friends, bestfriends, and special bonds that last a lifetime and the teachers do make the lessons interesting by class discussions, group work, and watching videos, playing spanish jeopardy and reading very good books in ELA. in 6th grade one of the books we read was \"Hatchet\", \"Walk Two Moons\". In 7th grade we read \"A wrinkle in time\", \"the giver\", \"Of mice and men\"Now in 8th grade some of the books are \"The Hunger Games\", \"The Fault In Our Stars\", \"Hotel on the corner of bitter and sweet\".
