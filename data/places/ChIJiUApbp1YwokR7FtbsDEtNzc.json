I asked for a x ray and a filling for my broken tooth. The staff (lady at front desk and teeth cleaner/x-ray staff) are phenomenal. So nice and amazing. But the main dentist. Dr. Shah is HORRIBLE! I’m trying to get one procedure done and she’s trying to get me to pay for 2 more procedures on the same day… She told me my insurance didn’t cover tooth fillings but, after calling elsewhere, my insurance should have covered it since it was one of my two front teeth. She is clearly lying and adding her name to trusted sources to call for insurance but then when you get there she will tell you insurance doesn’t cover it and that you have to fork out $250 or  she will refuse to do it and send you on your way.  If I wasn’t extremely desperate that day I would have refused but I just paid her and she did the procedure. The tooth feels so THIN! She told me not to bite down on anything hard but to be honest, with as thin as she made the tooth filling, I cannot bite down on anything at all. Not even a marshmallow. I’m planning to get this one replaced once I find a more trustworthy dentist. I’ve definitely learned a good lesson from this horrible dentist.. Always check the reviews. If 100 people are claiming someone is a liar, does horrible work and over charges please believe the reviews, we have no reason to lie. She really cons people and over charges them and her work isn’t even good. I’m sure the second I bite down on this tooth it’s all over and I definitely wasted $250 going to her location. Please heed my warning so you don’t get taken advantage of like I was. What a horrible dentist experience. I wish there was an option to give 0 stars…\n\nEdit also forgot to mention she numbed me for this procedure (a cap tooth) which doesn’t need it at all and was also trying to pull at my crown which is located right next to it and it felt as if she was trying to purposely make it loose or pull the cap down and completely off.
