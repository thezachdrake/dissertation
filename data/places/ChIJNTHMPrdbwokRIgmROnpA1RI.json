The matchas were pretty standard and the cardamom bun was a little\nbigger than other places. The soup was so amazing. It came with bread on the side, but all the flavors together with the spices in the soup and its almost paste-like texture made it so good on a cold day. The veggie sandwich was massive, almost inedible because everything kept pouring out of it. The picked vegetables and the marinated greens paired so well with the smoked salmon. I couldn’t get enough. The portion was also so so massive for the price. The crispy potato smørrebrød was acidic and savory in the best ways. Though it was smaller in portion to other dishes, it was dense and filling. Great texture and flavors on all the dishes. Cute lil shop where you can sit indoor or outdoor. And amazing bakery next door for just fika. Would definitely come here again and would highly recommend!!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Very rarely am I blown away by “hyped up places” these days but this is one of the few.
