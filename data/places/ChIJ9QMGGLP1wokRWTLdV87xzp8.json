The chef special salad is delicately seasoned with nuances pls or and made with the freshest greens. The desert flan was expertly made.

When I tell you this place was a disaster from start to finish. I stayed for an hour hoping this would get better but man it never did and I decided it be best to leave then lose my mind towards the owners who provided us a terrible experience. Firstly, we had a party of 15 people and were offered two packages one being $40 which included buffet style meals the options of  food were -GuacaMonica and fresh Tortilla Chips, meatballs in Salsa Chipotles, Flautas Doradas de Pollo, Fajitas de Pollo con tortillas y Arroz Azafran. Sounds good right? At least that’s what I thought. Then the second package being $80 which allowed you to part take in the buffet style meal and also open bar for 2 hours. Still sounds good right? Well it turned out this was a disaster. Firstly this buffet style meal was a total rip off!!! These items were offered in miniature size … they weren’t even things you could make a meal out of they were appetizers. Which was never told to us. For 15 people the amount of “appetizers” was not enough. They put 2-3 bowls of meat balls now the size of the bowls were small. These bowls they put out combined  wouldn’t have even filled a small metal tray that you would use when you make food for events. So that’s to tell you how much food they actually gave for 15 ADULT People. The chicken fajitas were not served with any tortillas or rice as they advertised to us. We just got fajita meat and again similar to spicy meat balls small bowls. Not even a full small tray which was crazy! The flautas were miniature size and similar to everything else. I think what they gave wouldn’t have even been half of a small tray. And guaca and chips again small portions. 4 small bowls not even cereal size bowls of guacamole with chips. For the amount of money we spent. For what it cost them to make the food they served us and what we paid. We were definitely robbed. And on top of that we weren’t supposed to even sit down. They expected us to stand because the owner Maria when I asked her where I can sit she said that this is a mingle party you don’t sit. You grab some appetizers and walk and mingle.  Why in god name would I go somewhere to stand for two hours. And eat standing. That is sooo ghetto, when my coworker who planned the event with the owners asked Maria about the rice and tortillas, because they never served us this. Maria gave the response if that was included you would have saw it on the table. When in email and text changes this was what was said and promised to us. So they don’t even follow what they promise and then they have the audacity to give you attitude when you ask about why are things not there. Totally unprofessional, also another thing a week prior to our event they tried to raise our prices. How professional is that. That’s not how any establishment should do business. My company has been in the area almost 15 years so we are very big on eating at local establishments to support businesses in our area. But this was a terrible evening. I left paying $40 and did not have even an actual plate of food. I left hungry disappointed and upset. I will never come back to eat at this place. I would never ever recommend this place. This place should be ashamed of themselves at how they treat customers and how they behave with their nasty and snotty comments towards us. Please save yourself the headache and stomach pains."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Went to this location yesterday for my company’s holiday party.
