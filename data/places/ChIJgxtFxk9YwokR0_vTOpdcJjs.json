Now my real issue what's the food. I should really give it a one-star. Everything looks great on the plate but the flavor was not there. For the price that we paid I'm very disappointed. I had the shrimp and grits and there was barely grits and hardly any flavor. One of my friends had the French toast and that was not good at all. Next the package was supposed to be unlimited Mimosa with an appetizer and the appetizer that I was mentioned was not the appetizer that was sent out. Overall I was just not satisfied with the food service.

The Rasta Pasta was nasty  🤮 it came with limited noodles and mini shrimps. It had a lot of bell peppers that were over powering the meals. I give that Rasta Pasta a 0/10 they need to look up how to make Rasta Pasta. Other than that the Big Apple Brunch was a vibe we came around 5 that’s when the party starts to get hype. There is this photographer that comes around and takes pictures she’s amazing, we did a little photo shoot and she was so nice. The waiter Paul is nice he was very attentive and busy at the same time. They also have hookah here. I brought cupcakes here and they charged me $25 to bring it.
