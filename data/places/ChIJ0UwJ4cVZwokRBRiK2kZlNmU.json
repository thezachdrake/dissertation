I tried the IV therapy as it was recommended based on what I’ve been experiencing. I will say I was a little nervous but they helped put my mind at ease and we even did a quick meditation in the beginning of the treatment to ease my mind which really let me sink into the experience and calm my nerves. Everything throughout the process was professional, clean and just an overall great and it was a transformative experience. The staff is really friendly and welcoming and you can tell they really believe in their treatments. This treatment really shifted my perspective on a lot of things and I was able to uncover some past deep traumas with a different outlook. I’ll definitely be going back to continue treatment and highly recommend them.
