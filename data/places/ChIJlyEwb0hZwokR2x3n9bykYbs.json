With its vibrant colors, tropical flairs, mosaics, tile work, rustic touches and cultural imagery, you definitely feel the deep Cuban heritage and history within the space.  Aside from the welcoming energy of Mi Salsa Kitchen, their food is great! We started off with Yuca for the table and it was crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. The sauce paired with the yuca had stronger notes of Mayo and a smoky flavor to it, which wasn’t my favorite, but could be interesting for others. Their chips and guacamole was also a nice addition to the table. This time around I ordered their steak tacos and they were the best tacos I’ve had in a while. The steak was juicy and seasoned nicely. The tacos were topped with crispy shallots which I’ve never seen done at any other locations and it really brings the dish to the next level with their extra crunch. The avacado crema that comes with the tacos is both amazing and refreshing with some good heat. You can’t go wrong with their rice and beans, rice is not dry nor soggy, but just where you want it. The black beans were flavorful. I typically opt for their coconut mojito which is always nice. I’ve come here once before on a Friday night and they had live music which was a nice intimate experience. Being it’s smaller inside it does get a little bit more packed at night but it’s worth it. Overall, I always recommend this spot.
