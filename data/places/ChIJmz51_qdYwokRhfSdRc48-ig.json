Who can complain with this non stop self service and full service place? They have a change machine here so no need to bring your own quarters. If you bring bills you will get coins. It’s super clean and super well lit and has a modern look and feel with renovation. It also feels super safe bc the 23rd Precinct (Police Station) is right next to it with a ton of cop cars all on this block. And if you are tired of this world of technology and using apps, giving your credit card info for hackers to get to, and having to download yet another app on your cell phone, this is the place for you! Quarters only. Costs as of 10/19/23: $2.50 small load, $3.75 medium load, $4.75 large load. Dryer: $0.25 per 5 minutes so 30 minutes costs $1.50 if you need math fast here. There are a total of 15 washing machines, 18 dryers, 10 carts to move wash from washer to dryers. They have a nice folding table. Everything is clean and there is no mold or foul odor. It’s a great experience bc you can watch one of the 2 TVs while you wait. The TVs have volume plus cc TV so you can read what’s being said and listen. There is a free bathroom for customers, free wifi, and there’s AC when it’s hot and heat when it’s cold. Today it was 60 degrees and they had the AC on to keep it from feeling humid so that was really nice while it was not cold blasting AC either which would feel very uncomfortable. They have a massage chair that costs $2 for 10 minutes and $5 for 30 minutes so get a nice massage while you wait for your laundry. There’s a vending machine w drinks and snacks but my dollar didn’t work and the nice attendant said the machine was not working whether you put bills or coins. I was looking fwd to my favorite childhood cookie - Lindens Butter crunch. Next time. They wash and fold your laundry based on weight. They also sell detergent. assumed incorrectly that the very nice staff person/attendant spoke Spanish due to this area having many Spanish speakers. But to my surprise and hers we both didn’t speak Spanish 😂. She said sorry she didn’t speak Spanish and I said sorry I don’t speak Spanish. But she spoke French. Never assume anything 😊. Just a great place to get your laundry done and to watch a streaming movie w their WiFi or watch the news on TV while you wait."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This laundromat is 24/7.
