I had surgery February 18th from 1 pm to 7 pm and was in a great deal of pain. It was abdominal surgery with 5 incisions and was laproscopic and robotic, to do partial hysterectomy. I was released on February 19th and it was not even 24 hours after my surgery. My doctor sent me home with one pain prescription - however that prescription was not enough because pain meds go according to weight. The pharmacist was very rude and angry and in spite of my husband having my driver's license and his own ID, did not want to fill the prescription for oxycodone.\nWhen my doctor called me the next day to see how how I was and I explained I was short on pain meds and in a lot of pain, she was very upset that I had to deal with aggravation and stress which doesn't help the pain. She then prescribed 30 pills since I needed 10 mg instead of 5, since she advised me to take 2 at a time. I had no pills left the next day and called Theresa. They said my prescription of 30 pills, 10 mg apiece was waiting for me. I said I'd be sending my husband, who is a very tall black man, to pick the prescription up. They said, \"No problem.\" My husband went to Theresa to get the prescription. When he entered the store, he heard the staff whispering \"Only 4 pills\" When he got to the counter, he was told, \"There's only 4 pills.\" Now this is crazy because I take one pill every 6 hours. They told him, \"Come back Monday for the rest. This is all we have.\" That would leave me without any pain meds after noon on Saturday. They told him, \"Go to another drug store for the rest.\" This is impossible to do with a narcotic. Then my husband got angry and said he did not understand what was happening since this is a legal prescription. Then after that the pharmacist yelled, \"of course this is a drug store and we have plenty of meds.\" and my husband said, \"So what is the problem then? My wife is in a lot of pain and I'm not leaving until you give her the meds she is prescribed. I don't see the problem.\" Then finally they got on the phone to the doctor after this and then suddenly, they magically had all the pills prescribed. This whole thing seems crazy to me and I don't understand it. Obviously my doctor told them to give me the pills. They then told my husband never to come back and to tell me to not come back either.\nThis is very stressful for someone in a lot of pain to have to deal with this. All I can think is it’s because my husband is big and black. Why would they want to deny pain meds to someone who has legally prescribed pain meds after a big surgery? Suddenly after the phone call and claiming they only had 4 pills and that there was no more in the store, they suddenly had the entire prescription of 30 pills.\n\nThey then told my husband don’t come back here and tell your wife never to come back either."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I don't understand what happened here.
