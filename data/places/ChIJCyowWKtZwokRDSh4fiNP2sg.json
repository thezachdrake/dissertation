There’s no hard selling at Argyle events, which makes it a refreshing change from other conferences. At these events, no one is trying to sell you anything and the purpose is just to learn and to network. Additionally, Argyle events are free to attend. I have left every event with useful takeaways, and also several good business connections I made during the networking breaks. I’ve found their staff to be super-efficient and helpful, especially when I needed to find a private room to take an important phone call. I highly recommend Argyle’s events to senior-level business people who are eager to learn and make great business connections."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Argyle Executive Forum runs great conferences.
