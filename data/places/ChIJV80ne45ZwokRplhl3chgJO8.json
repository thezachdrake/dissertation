Even though I informed that I was just looking around, Trina went above and beyond to really listen to what I was looking for and find many multiple options (she was also receptive to listings that I found which I greatly appreciated). Not only that, because I had zero knowledge, she spent a lot of time helping me understand the process especially with co-ops. It was all overwhelming and she was very patient with me. I ended up finding a unicorn. I found a co-op alcove studio in lower Manhattan for a little over half a million with maintenance less than $1.5K that I converted into a one bedroom. My apartment renewal lease was going to be almost on par with my mortgage + maintenance. Knowing I wanted to live in NYC for the rest of my life, this was the best decision ever from a financial and comfort perspective. I don't know if this will be my forever home but if I'm ever on the market again, I will undoubtedly reach back out to Trina.
