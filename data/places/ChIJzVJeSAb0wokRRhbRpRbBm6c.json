source of major, serious personal stress. I have some chronic health problems, and I need to take a large number of medications in order to stay healthy. I didn't choose this. It's the card I was dealt. Having a functioning pharmacy is essential to keeping me in adequate health. The first problem with the pharmacy department at this CVS--which I have made formal complaints about repeatedly, and which I can see others have mentioned in their reviews--is that it never--and I mean NEVER--answers phone calls from customers. The phone rings briefly, and then you get sent into a voicemail that's for providers rather than customers, and even if you leave a voicemail there, you'll never get a call back and your issue will never get addressed. If there's any issue or complication with one of your prescriptions that can't be dealt with through the app, Web site, or automated phone options--and this is something that comes up often with prescription medication--your only option is to go there physically to insist the matter be addressed (of course, this can be time-consuming). And when you're there, the pharmacy staff will be surly. They act like any customer who expresses dissatisfaction is a \"Karen\" and like doing their jobs is optional (and, of course, they don't resolve the issue you've raised). A Karen, among other things, is someone who is demanding and entitled beyond what is reasonable. But it's reasonable to expect your pharmacy to answer the phone. It's reasonable to expect very basic courtesy and customer service from your pharmacy. And it's reasonable to expect that your pharmacy won't willy-nilly cancel the shipment of your prescriptions--which this CVS has done to me repeatedly and with no valid explanation (while keeping the money I've already paid for a product I have not received--which almost crosses the line into conduct that could result in criminal liability). As a last resort, I have three times now had to call CVS corporate, and they will exert themselves slightly more than the local CVS staff to help with your issue, but at the end of the day, they don't typically provide a resolution either. I can think of one issue they resolved satisfactorily, one time. I have been a CVS customer for, I would estimate, more than twenty years. I've stuck with CVS because, as a large chain, it should in theory make it easy to transfer prescriptions when you move. Again, I take a lot of prescriptions to manage a lot of health issues, and I need to be able to access those medications as seamlessly as possible. And CVS makes it difficult to transfer prescriptions out of their system. So as a CVS customer, you get kind of stuck. They make it difficult to take your business elsewhere. But as bad as things have been, customers are going to begin to drift away. I doubt people at CVS will read this, and if they do, I doubt they'll care or take any action. But the level of dysfunction at this particular CVS is so bad that CVS very well may find it needs to shutter this branch. That said, CVS can turn this situation around if someone there will care and will take responsibility."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I rarely write negative reviews, but my experience with the pharmacy department at this CVS has been so intensely negative that it has become a source of major, serious personal stress.

The CVS website very clearly says that Novavax COVID boosters are available at all locations and an appointment is not necessary for it. I showed up and they wouldn't even give me a flu shot, and I was told (rudely) that the FDA hasn't even approved Novavax yet, which is patently untrue -- a quick Google can tell you that. \"We have it but we're not giving it out.\" I could have pulled out my phone and showed them where on their own website it says this version of the vaccine is available at all locations with no appointment, but it wouldn't have made a difference. I went to the Duane Reade across the street instead and they were lovely."},"publishTime":"2023-11-21T16:27:14Z"}],"viewport":{"high":{"latitude":40.8638798302915,"longitude":-73.9241482697085},"low":{"latitude":40.8611818697085,"longitude":-73.9268462302915}},"businessStatus":"OPERATIONAL","currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":8,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":0,"hour":21,"date":{"day":18,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":8,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":1,"hour":21,"date":{"day":19,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":8,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":2,"hour":21,"date":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":8,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":3,"hour":21,"date":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":8,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":4,"hour":21,"date":{"day":22,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":8,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":5,"hour":21,"date":{"day":23,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":8,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0},"close":{"day":6,"hour":21,"date":{"day":17,"month":2,"year":2024},"minute":0}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Saturday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM","Sunday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM"]},"shortFormattedAddress":"130 Dyckman St, New York"}
