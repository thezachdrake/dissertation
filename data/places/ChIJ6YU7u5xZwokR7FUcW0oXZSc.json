The staff was so darn sweet, and the musician was lovely playing both Italian and 90s hits to switch it up with their accordion. The icing on the cake was when we inquired about a dessert liquor to pair with their pies to end the night. With nothing specific on hand, the bartender went out of his way to make us a special concoction from what was available. It was basically a dessert on its own that I could have sipped all night.
