You enter a safe and tranquil environment where it feels possible to take a deep breath. You are welcomed by a lovely and friendly staff who offers you tea or water.\n\nI have struggled with an autoimmune disease for a decade. I have been in and out of the hospital multiple times and have seen Dr. Erickson in my worst moments.  Not only has she been able to help alleviate my physical symptoms with her systematics work on my body, but her contributions to my state-of-mind are not to be underestimated.  At some of my lowest moments, she has been there to hold my anxiety and quiet my nervous system through her work, which is key in quelling autoimmune symptoms.  She has the rare gift of being both a doctor as well as a light-worker, which is not something I have encountered before.\n\nDr Erickson is part of my “team” of people — doctors and body workers — who have supported me through my challenging health journey.  She has taken the time to talk to my other doctors, yoga teacher, and acupuncturist — everyone involved in my well being, so that everyone is on same page and working towards  a comprehensive understanding on what is going on with my body.\n\nI first found Dr. Erickson years ago when an OT who was working with my youngest son (who was just 2 years old at the time) suggested that Karen was the only chiropractor and craniosacral therapist whom she trusted to work with small children.  I can tell you that not only did we see immediate improvements in our son, but now all 3 of my children see her regularly as part of a way of keeping their very active bodies (lots of after-school sports in our house!) healthy and pain-free.  I often get chastised by them if they feel it’s been too long between sessions with her!\n\nI cannot recommend Erickson Healing Arts strongly enough.
