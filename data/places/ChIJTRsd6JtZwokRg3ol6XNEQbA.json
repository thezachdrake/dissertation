I was hopeful after my phone screening because Carol seemed like a nice person, but after her shock in realizing I was in fact the one to be interviewed, I knew it was downhill from there. Firstly, I didn't like how I wasn't escorted to an area off the sales floor in order to have her undivided attention. I was under the impression that if hired, I would have close to full time hours based on what we spoke about on the phone. However, I get there and Carol tells me, all she's looking for is Saturday and Sunday help. I have a well rounded retail career and what the job entailed wasn't outside my field of expertise aside from foot measurement. Carol asks if I have worked with kids in any respect, which I have including babysitting my younger family members. She then proceeds to ask me if I've been to college which threw me off guard because 1) You're only paying minimum wage and this is an entry level position and 2) IF I had enough college experience under my belt, why would I NOT list it on my resume? If you don't see a university, it clearly means I either didn't attend or dropped out which was honestly none of her business. Now onto the good stuff, after several awkward moments and Carol barely paying attention to any of my responses, because she kept getting side tracked by customers, I was met with microagressions about my appearance. For context, my Google profile picture is exactly what I looked like for the interview, just with a black turtleneck. Carol proceeds with her audacity and asks if the piercing between my eyes is removable. With all due respect, why would I alter my already altered appearance for a minimum wage job that's offering me less than part time hours? Apparently my look is \"too radical\" to the point where it may upset children and their parents. I wish I was making this up. After that last straw and her whole \"we have a plethora of candidates to consider\" spiel, I already knew I wasn't going to get the job and I honestly think it's for the best. It's 2023 , not 1983 , people in their 20s ESPECIALLY in NYC are going to look different, the way a person looks DOES NOT determine their work ethic. I do hope the company continues to flourish seeing as how they're a small business who survived the pandemic, but it's about time for Carol and her husband to retire."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a year ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Very disappointing interview experience.
