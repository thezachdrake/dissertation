JECKLE TURNED INTO MR. HYDE AND WENT FROM 5 STARS TO 2\n\nI'm shocked I'm making such a low review when days ago they had 5 in my book. It was a rough beginning of the summer when my bike was stolen, but I trusted the owner of this establishment to do a great job putting my new custom Bigshot together that I had it shipped directly to his establishment.\n\nThe job he did was great. The bike cost me $425 (not incl tax) and assembly of the bike pkus replacing stock tires with Gator Shells, a plush seat for the narrow one and an anti-theft device for the seat ran me $371. For me money well spent for the upgrades and a job well done.\n\nI then broke a NYC cardinal rule and left my bike parked for 4 days in the same place with three NYC Kryptonite locks recurring the frame and both wheels. I checked on it every evening around midnight and in the morning around 6am and everything was fine. I told myself the only thing they can get is the handle bars. The 5th I foun that they took both the bars and the forks.\n\nI dropped the bike off at Talent Cycles and the owner took the bike in to keep what was left safe while I contact Bigshot Bikes for replacement parts. Bigshot told me the bars and forks are sold with the frame as one unit, but that they were having a sale dropping the price from $425 to $325 and gave me a special code to knock the price down to $260.\n\nDistraught I went back to Talent Cycles and asked the owner to see if he could find the parts for replacement. He told me to come back next week. One week later he said he found nothing, but it would\"ve cost me $200 plus to replace it. He told me to purchase the bike, send it to him and that he would do it for free because I was also purchasing anti-theft devices for the forks and the wheels as well as a tool box with optional saddle bags for storage totaling well over $200 in business.\n\nWhen the bike finally came in he said it would be done by 4pm the next day and when I returned it was still being built. No biggie I came back the next day and the bike wasn't there. After a while his worker came in with it after what I presumed was a test drive with the new tires soiled and grease on parts of the frame. While I was waiting the owner was giving me attitude, but I thought he was just having a bad day.\n\nI then inquired about the ant-theft upgrades and he snapped back at me that he couldn't find them after telling me he had it in the store. I noticed that my light mount attached to the seat shaft was missing (see first pic after robbery). The helper said it wasn't there and the owner said the thieves must've taken it in a short curt tone. I took my bike and brought it to my storage space where I new it would be safe.\n\nI spotted the mount in the pics took for the police report that evening and the next day went in to purchase the tool box with saddle bags and of course remove what was left of my $425 bike. Once again I was met with attitude and haste from the owner and he got even angrier when I showed him the evidence in the picture. I brushed it off that maybe he was having another bad day. But then after half looking for it in a cluttered drawer he slammed it shut and barked what color WHITE OR RED? Perplexed I tried to describe what I wanted to accomplish and he said that he, \"didn't have time for this\" and I quickly replied red. He then tossed a tiny $5 red light on to the counter at me exclaiming to me it was bettet than the one I bought online for $20 (not really).\n\nWhen I told him that I wanted to get the remnents of my bike he angrily barked in Spanish to his assistant who brought me the parts missing just one seat from the original build. The owner grabbed it and remanded me calling me nit picky for everything and that I was ungrateful for him building this bike for free.\n\nI told him it was quite the opposite. I was very grateful and asked him he got my note on messanger to see that I put up posts on Facebook and Instagram edifying his place with 5 stars.
