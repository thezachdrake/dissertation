The gazpacho was one of our favorites, a perfect amount of creaminess and fresh crisp and sweetness from the grape and cucumber(?) in the middle. The eggplant dish was also a fav contender because of the miso base that tasted basically like a rich tonkatsu broth, despite being vegan! The rice pudding was stellar as well, the red bean ice cream blending perfectly with the salty crispy rice puff and the fruits in the pudding. Textures and flavors melded exquisitely with every course, and would happily come back another time when the tasting menu changes. Needless to say the wine pairing was excellent as well, every note and interaction that our server described came across, and added so much characteristic to each dish. 10/10 restaurant if you’re looking for Michelin star fine dining at a respectable price point for the quality and experience."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"One of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had and definitely the best vegan dining experience I’ve had!

I have been lucky enough to dine around the world and have had a few Michelin star experiences. This one was tops. This meal will be remembered fondly for the entirety of my life. My friend and I both enjoyed the Omnivore tasting menu and the wine pairing. The worry with a tasting menu is that you will be full before you finish, hungry when you leave, or that each dish couldn’t possibly be delicious. This tasting menu blew all of the preconceived notions of what a tasting menu should be out of the water. Each dish was a flavor sensation. It was the perfect amount of food for a full experience. And the wine pairing was absolutely outrageous — I was wildly impressed with each combination. The wines were so delicious that my friend and I asked for pictures of a few of the bottle labels to look for when we return home.\nFinally, our server Bobby made the entire experience memorable. He was attentive, friendly, casual, caring, funny, welcoming, informative. Bobby made us feel like we were his only table for the night, like we were in his living room, like we could be friends for life. I would visit 1000 more times to sit and chat with Bobby. We had friends show up at the tail end of our meal and he invited them to sit next to us, treated them to a glass of dessert wine, and gave them the cookie box that complemented our meal. I can’t imagine ever having better service than what we received from Bobby.\nI will be recommending The Musket Room to everyone I know, forever. I hope it is open for decades to come, I will be returning every time I am in NYC. I would give 6 out of 5 stars if I could, rate it an 11 out of 10.
