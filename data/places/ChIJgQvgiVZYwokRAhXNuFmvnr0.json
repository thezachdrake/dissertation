My first visit was a bit scattered, I walked away with her telling me that she could and would help me. My second visit came and I felt she was unprepared and not fully aware of what had been discussed or what she had planned for me, so I reminded her of what we discussed. It's sad to pay a fee to see someone that does not appear to have everything in line or prepared for you when you have such high hopes. She asked for my blood work results when she had not sent me a prescription to get blood work done. My frustration grew but I had already invested time and money on our visits. I then went for blood work. The results were returned to her. When I contacted her office to review them I was asked to call back or that she would return my call. This did not happen. I had to call back again and again till I was able to get her on the phone.  I was then told to send her information so that she would provide me with prescription details. I did this, again no response, via text or telephone.\nI gave up! I had to go back to step 1 and begin looking for someone to assist with my original issue. 2 months wasted in time. Consultations paid for. I would not recommend Corinne Furnari because the testimonials or reviews that I read about her were absolutely not lived up to. In fact I would not have rated her 1 star had I not had to be able to post this review."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I did what I thought was thorough research on someone that could assist me with my condition of hypothyroidism.
