Along with Brother and Sister Weist which were also temple workers and had the sweetest and most inviting spirit!!!wr came here with our daughter for service work and enjoyed the beautiful building and spirit of the Savior.  After we went upstairs because we heard there were beautiful paintings and I didn’t realize that the church chapel was upstairs.  Never seen that’s before above a temple but it looked just like the chapel buildings back at home in Utah.  It has a great layout and Everything they needed.  Inside this building was also a family history area.  I was so surprised to see how much they were able to build at that location.  The Temple is built in a beautiful location close to Central Park and like always the temple grounds are well kept.
