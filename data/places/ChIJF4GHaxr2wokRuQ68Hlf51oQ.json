October 9, 2022, I visited Ipanema Laundry, something I have done many times over many years. The woman on duty was a woman I have observed many times over many years. She quickly made my list as one of the least desirable workers in the local area, but I endured her unpleasant, unsavory character out of respect for the company’s owner and relative—they’re among the best immigrant business owners in the area. This diabolical woman seems to be on a mission to imperil the well-being of others. Yesterday, like most days she’s on duty, she occupied almost all machines (despite being full of customers waiting for machines), and prioritized her own work over the customers (forcing customers to approach her so that they could wash/dry clothes). I waited for this unprincipled woman to notice her error. When she emptied a machine (as someone approached her) it was full of dog hair and black dirt. (I always clean the inside and outside of public washing machines: my health matters.) I told her I'd need another machine (noting the dirty, hair), she argued the machine was clean: this is a much larger issue. (With COVID, Monkey Pox, bedbugs, and other communicable, undesirable conditions spread by poor hygiene and unsanitary practices, this woman was being paid to clean dirty laundry, yet— didn’t do it. She let filth remain in the machine to get on someone else’s laundry.) I warned a man that machine was full of dog hair and filth (the worker refused to acknowledge or clean it), he thanked me generously.\nI approached her again: she occupied almost all of the dryers (many not in use) and she (of course) went to the dryer of the clothes dirtied with dog hair and filth and said: you’re not going to want this, you’ll say it’s not clean. (A diligent, decent worker would have offered me another dryer from the others not in use—not this woman.) I said: and yet, I need to dry my clothes. Do you have paper towel? (So that I might clean what she wouldn’t.) You wouldn’t put your clothes in there. Her: (smiling) This last comment broke my resolve to stay silent and endure, I decided then to post this review. For all of the time I have known this woman, she treated me like I was an illegal migrant from a third-world nation, unfit to smell her dung or piss, who had trespassed U.S. borders, with no adherence to customs and courtesies. In fact, I’ve sent cases to The United States Supreme Court! Undeserving, irreverent, disrespectful, uncouth, unkept, unlearned, and greedy people—like this diabolical woman—wreak havoc on U.S. communities that would THRIVE if not for the constantly new threats to safety, health, and well-being from people—like this woman. The last incident involving this diabolical woman involved a GUN being fired outside the laundry: I noted the precarious, endangered situation [created by this miscreant!] myself and others faced; packed in like sardines because of this malicious woman. [She creates chaos when on duty in the apparent attempt frustrate people, so they leave rather than use the laundry when she’s there.]\nWe can’t AFFORD the consequences of cheap, unvetted, unscrupulous workers. Our health is important: we can’t afford workers that do NOT work, or that do so in a manner that imperils our health, safety, or viability. We aren’t a dumping ground for the unscrupulous and unvetted. Those who aren’t faithful in the small things (e.g., laundry) would bring chaos if allowed to have a hand in greater things (e.g., schools, government, dealing with personal identification information of Americans).
