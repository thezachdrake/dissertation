The two bathrooms I'm sorry to say are really nasty. Not kept up with and dirty. The place obviously makes money, the owner Jay should really invest in doing some renovations. I understand it's a 'dive' bar, but I've been to dive bars that are clean and their bathrooms are spotless. There's a lot of room for improvement there. Also,  lately, they never have a good beer selection. I'm not sure what's going on, but they are very limited with beer selections which is not good. Other than that, the bartenders are super nice, the owner's wife is so sweet and always moving around doing something. She's great.
