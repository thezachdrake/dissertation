Virtuoso resources is the only place that I know of the caters to this niche. Harold, the violin dealers who owns this business, is patient and very helpful and makes the process of finding an instrument very pleasant and even fun. He offers advice based on the playing style ,personality, and financial limits of the individual violinist. I made a recent purchase from Harold. After playing the instrument for several months I decided i wanted to upgrade and went back to Harold. He treated me more than fairly, and once again helped search further. Together we found the instrument that was the right fit for me. I enjoyed the process as well as finding the instrument. This stellar level of customer service is becoming more difficult to find than it once was in NY, and that's a shame.\nIf your looking to rent or buy a violin, go see Harold."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"7 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Places to buy and play quality violins in the $500-$20,000 range in NYC are few and far between.
