How much more? Enough that I’ve been here for seven+ consecutive nights! Just imagine!\n\nThe highlight for me is the humble and timid like young man at the register by the name of Juan! He’s special! Timid smile with a patient energy and attitude who is very knowledgeable about his culture and its foods/drinks! He’s literally here every single night I’ve frequented here! He’s sacrificed his summer nights to assist his family business owned and ran by his awesome mother, Lilia who stands out with crimson bright dyed hair short in stature but you can tell she means business! How honorable of him! What a dynamic mother son duo!\n\nFrom the moment I stepped in, oddly enough? I felt home if home was the heart of Mexico – warm and inviting ambiance decorated with trinkets and things that set the tone for an authentic no frills Mexican dining experience! From murals to hanging mini sombreros down to the creative hand written menus decorating the walls coercing you to be more personable and ask about the food instead of aimlessly scouring a menu to pick a meal.\n\nAt this point? Young Juan already knows my custom order! Three mushroom veggie tacos with beans replacing the broccoli, accompanied by guacamole on top! If I’m feeling extra I get one if there in house naturally made juices like their delicious pineapple juice, or hibiscus or in house horchata that are sure to compliment mi comida(my food)! Never overly seasoned or salty it’s made just right to fit the palate with condiments of sour creams and hot sauce to custom tailor to your liking! I love having that control; not having the venue dictate that for me! They also take well to smh constructive feedback I provide them if the food was off because the chef was different on the grill that given night, etc etc etc.\n\nThe other highlight of course is my go to meal in the veggie mushroom tacos(I don’t eat meat) with an awesome blend of textures! Each bite holds its own! Tacos so filling I’m beginning to think they’re mini unraveled burritos haha. The mushrooms were perfectly sautéed, offering a meaty richness that beautifully complimented with the fresh grilled vegetables. The combination is nothing short of perfect for to me. Mexican music serenading me while I eat feels so warm here. I sometimes doze off I get so comfortable haha making these tacos and a visit to “El Paisa”(“the country”)an absolute must-try for anyone in the uptown, NYC Washington Heights area especially since they’re open late until 2:30AM!\n\nOverall, “El Paisa” stands as a shining example of what a small hole in wall Mexican restaurant should be. Great tacos and excellent or food with even better customer service! It has carved a special place for me and will forever be one of “my spots”.
