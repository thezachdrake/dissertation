The sushi selection impressed me, particularly the quality of the fish and the delicious variety of flavors. Each piece was flavorful, and the chef was friendly, enhancing the experience with an amazing performance. Additionally, this omakase restaurant is BYOB, allowing you to bring your own drinks to perfectly complement the course. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend the 17-piece course at $98.
