The Circle is their version of a wedge which is so much easier to eat & means the dressing is better distributed. It’s hard to choose an entree with the excellent pastas, the juicy prime rib (sliced in front of you from the cart) and the dry-aged porterhouse are so good! If available, you must get the duck or John Dory specials - both are spectacular. My favorite dessert is the Cloud Cake, light and not too sweet!
