After having our venue cancel on us last minute, along with our caterers and florist deciding they did not want to travel to the new venue- literally nothing was going right. During all of this Victoria never once made us worry, she was more than happy to be flexible and work around our situation. Weddings are stressful and expensive, but Victoria did everything she could to make our wedding day the best day and her work was absolutely worth every penny. I could not have been happier.
