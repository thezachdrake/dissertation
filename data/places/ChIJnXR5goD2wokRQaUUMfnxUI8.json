I honestly think that she was high because not only did that happen but my less than 1 year old son at that time came home acting like he didn't eat and have his milk all day. I do not recommend this daycare at all. I trusted her because she is from the same church I used to go to and knew my family but obviously that was a mistake but never again will I be making that same mistake and I truly hope no one else does too. Her attitude and mouth is absolutely disgusting and I don't trust her with my child or anyone else's child because of it. I'm just being honest. She made me very very very disappointed in her."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Marvina is VERY unprofessional with answering simple questions like when was the last time that he ate and had his milk so I won't over feed him or not feed him when I'm supposed to.
