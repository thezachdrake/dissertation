incredible sh-t show.\nNo one knows who's supposed to make your appointments after the first one and you will end up with gaps early on because of this lack of protocol and lack of actually monitoring the patients.\nI was first given a physical therapist who showed up 15 minutes late and cut out 10 minutes early so the appointment was less than half the time scheduled for the evaluation. She also was unable to use basic technology.\nI was told to contact the office manager. The people on the phone lie to you telling you this person is going to call you back (even specifying when) but she never will and it will take you 5 days of trying to reach her till you finally get her on the line after being hung up on another three times.\nThey gave me a different therapist named Kassandra aka Kassi who was just plain obnoxious mean and nasty. Apparently she resented having to take an early evening slot. She had a terrible attitude, and was hostile about any physical therapy questions. She started out by showing a negative attitude for my chronic illness, talking derogatorily about it and showed she clearly didn't understand what it actually is (she expressed very wrong ideas about it from about two decades ago, before more scientific research clarified it).\nShe literally withheld all possible important information (even when asked)–refusing to provide information about how to do the exercises properly, how and when to use things like ice, etc. She was passive aggressive to the max. She wanted me to do something which I am physically unable to do and which my specialist has told me to *never* even think about doing because it would massively exacerbate my chronic illness, so when I told her all that, she kept arguing with me and ignoring what I was saying, then she obnoxiously an absurdly wrote into my chart notes which are visible in the hss app that I \"refused\" to do it. She wrote a lot of false statements into the chart. She was stressing me out by massively hurrying me because they have some agenda to hurry patients through really fast, not at all concerned about doing the wrong thing for the patient, and she kept lying about how many appointments I was going to have and continuously whittling it down to so few I wasn't even given the complete program. She didn't do the normal and safe thing, which would be to have a human being progress at their own rate, and only decide how many appointments after progress has actually been monitored. Nothing was monitored or appropriate.\nShe gave me instruction sheets with all wrong information about what exercises I should do at home, and indicated she couldn't be bothered when I asked her to provide accurate ones (she then wrote a misspelled word or two onto the inaccurate ones and still did not correct the fact that they were inaccurate sheets).\nThe place claims to have sessions available even as \"late\" as 6:30 p.m. and schedulers will initially book you for those, but the physical therapists are always wanting to cut out early and they'll purposely not even give you the entire exercise program just so they can get rid of anyone scheduling after 5:00 p.m..\nLiterally EVERYONE at this facility lies and lies and lies, and lies about the lies. Everyone from the phone answering people, to the physical therapists, to the PT supervisors, to the useless office manager. The supervisors and office manager make themselves completely inaccessible. The whole place is a giant mess, the physical therapy is bad, and no one has a healing attitude towards patients.\nI can't believe these people at HSS are getting insurance money for their extremely uncaring, remiss, dangerous and unprofessional \"services\" when I could get something safer and better from even a YouTube video from a non-physical therapist, without the nasty attitude and the extremely dangerous mad hurry and  unnecessary pain they inflict on patients, ultimately doing more harm than anything."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"in the last week","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Hands down the WORST physical therapy place, with the worst employees, I've been to, (and I've been to many in my life.)\nThe entire place is an incredible sh-t show.\nNo one knows who's supposed to make your appointments after the first one and you will end up with gaps early on because of this lack of protocol and lack of actually monitoring the patients.\nI was first given a physical therapist who showed up 15 minutes late and cut out 10 minutes early so the appointment was less than half the time scheduled for the evaluation.
