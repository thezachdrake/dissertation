prices, New King’s Wok would suffice.\n\nAs for the flavor and quality of the food, I think a true 3 stars is justified, not 4.5 as Google Maps suggests. It’s OK. Nothing more, nothing less. My girlfriend and I ordered multiple items: beef with broccoli, chicken curry with onions, and an order of crab rangoon.\n\nThe beef with broccoli was a combo platter and came with fried rice and an egg roll. Long story short, if this was the only dish I tried, I wouldn’t go back to the restaurant. The side of fried rice quickly became entirely one-noted, as there are no veggies or acid or anything to break-up the heaviness of the flavors. And the artificial smoke flavor of the little diced pieces of pork was not my favorite. The same characteristics can be found across the rest of the dish, itself, as it all just started to taste “heavy” and oily after only a few bites. There were also a handful of chewy pieces of beef and the dish needed more of the sauce drizzled on-top. The egg roll was spectacular, however, as it was one of the most layered and hearty and delicate I’ve ever had. But I would not order this meal again, at least not without some modifications. I really didn’t like it much at all.\n\nThe curry chicken with onions was very tasty in its own right and it was my favorite part of the meal. It has a light but rich flavor and I found myself continuing to sneak bites from my partner’s plate. Our only critique is that it, too, became very one-note after only a few bites and would have benefited massively from a mix of vegetables in the dish, rather than offering just onions.\n\nLast but not least, the crab rangoon was delicious and the portion was huge, too, especially for $5. It scratched that taste-profile itch very, very well. More not need be said, thankfully.\n\nFor the price, convenience, and freshness of the food, this place an easy “local spot” contender. Plus every order over $25 gets two free cans of soda, which was a nice touch. But the restaurant is not without its flaws; you know exactly what you’re going to get, for better or worse. There are simply multiple opportunities for New King’s Wok to take the typical New York fare and make it entirely classic in its own new, unique way."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"10 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"If you’re looking for an average won’t-amaze-or-entirely-disappoint-you, American-style Chinese food, one with massive portions and excellent prices, New King’s Wok would suffice.\n\nAs for the flavor and quality of the food, I think a true 3 stars is justified, not 4.5 as Google Maps suggests.
