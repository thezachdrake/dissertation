I had been dreaming about my French onion soup for what felt like over a year and knew with all my other reservations while I was in the city that it would just have to be a quick pick up situation or a bar sitting. Walked into the restaurant, planning to go to the bar and / or sit at a table for just soup and maybe pasta. Was met by the hostess who was beyond rude. I had called the restaurant earlier that day to inquire about a table as well as what time service was over at the restaurant I was told over the phone that 11:45 kitchen closes and that the restaurant closed at midnight. Well, to my surprise, I was there at 11, maybe a little before, and there was an issue getting soup.\n\nThe hostess kept repeating herself, saying the kitchen was closed and that she didn't know who I had spoken with. I asked for a manager who honestly I can't recall his name and didn't care for the interaction as he really seemed disinterested and disingenuous during our interaction at first. He did, however, seat us at a table and send over bread and my soup eventually. He stood over me, trying to rush me when I had stated that I may want to order something else as well stating the kitchen was closed. It was like a running theme, I thought I was ina bad Broadway musical at one point.\n\nLet's set the scene because the restaurant still had several guests seated. Some of which still hadn't received entrees. The kitchen wasn't closed and again it was soup... not a 10 course meal I wanted to order. As I waited with my mother, who had completely lost her appetite and refused to eat, we observed other food coming out of the \"closed kitchen.\" Another manager actually visited the table. I think he may be an assistant, but he was familiar and kind as I had, had previous interactions with him when I had visited the restaurant prior. I did tell him what had transpired as well as how rude the hostess had been. I think what really turned the experience unpleasant is that the hostess spoke to me initially as I was beneath her. I want to be clear I wasn't dressed up as I normally am when I visit the restaurant. However, I'm sure my outfit costed more than she makes in a week. My handbag alone is 6 months' rent for most people. None of which should matter. However, with her, it seemed to.\n\nNevertheless, the soup made it out of the kitchen and wasn't as hot as it should have been. It ended up not being as good as I remembered either. I do think that simply was because of the horrible interactions and how difficult it was to get the soup, I was completely turned off. I had them box up everything and took it back to the hotel. They covered the cost of the soup, which was unnecessary as I would have greatly just appreciated a flawless dining experience instead. I over tipped the person who boxed up dinner and departed the restaurant.\n\nI feel it is important to mention that there were still many people in the restaurant and bar when we left for the evening. I truly understand that hospitality is hard, New York, and more specifically Times Square is difficult, but this is what this restaurant signed up for. It's the holidays. This is when you really make the bulk of your revenue. Nobody is giving me a discount, and this isn't a soft opening. I don't expect to be met with mediocre service, sub-par food, and rudeness from your hourly hostess when I am paying well up for let's be honest soup!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Where do I start?
