Regarding her business practices in general she's very fair & upfront w/ pricing and what's needed to achieve desired result (no surprise fees or charges). Rosie's flat out honest about what results you can expect & has an excellent eye for what's best aesthetically pleasing for your unique face shape/structure. I love her no nonsense approach. She skips thru any B.S. and is all about amazing results & passion for her work. If you're on a budget (who's not?) Rosie makes excellent recommendations for a plan going forward to maintain results & stay within my budget (i.e. areas I can get away with only treating 2x a year vs every 3 months). Overall I've been very impressed with Rosie's  professionalism, skills, & knowledge. I love her confidence as instead of upselling or pushing more treatments, Rosie seems to make her work & results speak for themselves.
