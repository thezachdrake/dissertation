When I informed them about this, they suggested I buy an adapter. After purchasing the adapter, I connected the treadmill and it was deficient. A few days later, they sent a technician, and he found that its circuit board had burnt. It took over a month to replace the main circuit board in the machine. After using it twice, the screen showed an error message that said “DC MOTOR FAULT”, and the machine stopped working. The technician had to come back to replace the circuit board a second time. Since then, the machine turns on at random times, sometimes in the middle of the night. Since the product is defective, I asked for a replacement. I still haven’t received a reply from the manufacturer. I also purchased a Recline Personal stationary bike, which is already showing signs of wear and tear after using it 10 times at regular speeds. The seat makes an annoying screechy noise. They sent a technician to fix the bolts, but this hasn’t changed anything. The products aren't worth a fraction of their price, and the service is just as bad. I deeply regret my decision of purchasing Technogym equipment.
