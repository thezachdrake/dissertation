We feel so safe living here with all the extra security precautions: diligent check in process, key access elevators, package logging system, the list goes on. Maintenance is also incredibly responsive, usually responding within 1-2 hours at our door. The amenities are a huge plus, we love the resident equinox gym, sauna/steam rooms, pool, and there’s even a FULL SIZE basketball court in the basement level! The location is close enough to 42nd st subway stops and PABT, so it makes transportation anywhere a breeze. Lastly - the view is truly spectacular.
