In 2018, my family celebrated our new home by purchasing a Casper mattress. Initially, we were thrilled with its comfort and design.

We spent countless nights worrying and visiting doctors, trying to find the cause. We never imagined our mattress could be the culprit.\n\nFast forward to 2023, we discovered that our Casper mattress contained fiberglass, a detail not clearly disclosed at the time of purchase. This revelation was alarming, given the health issues we faced. Once we removed the mattress and thoroughly cleaned our home, our family’s health improved significantly.\n\nWhen I reached out to Casper for acknowledgment or compensation for our ordeal, their response was disheartening. They stated they couldn’t offer any resolution beyond the 100-day trial period, citing their warranty terms. “Casper does not and has never offered refunds as a resolution to a warranty claim as we cannot process any returns or refunds on orders after the end of the items' trial period, which in the case of mattresses, is 100 days from the initial date of delivery, but we are responsible for replacing any items that have been proven defective.”\n\n“Per our warranty within our terms of service, which you have agreed to by purchasing with us, we may submit a warranty claim in the case of any proven manufacturing defect.”  Ours is not a proven manufacturing defect, it coldly stated.  But wait, I didn’t agree to fiberglass by purchasing with Casper.  They referred me to a website starting starting with the word “legacy” that had all the FAQs of fiberglass, showing this was not their first rodeo and that they were clearly aware of the issue.\n\nI am writing this review as an eye-opener for others. Be vigilant about the materials in your mattress, especially if you have young children. Our story is a cautionary tale about the unseen dangers in everyday products and the importance of transparency from companies.\n\nI hope this review helps others to make informed decisions and possibly avoid the distress our family experienced."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I’m compelled to share our family’s experience with Casper Mattress to inform potential buyers.
