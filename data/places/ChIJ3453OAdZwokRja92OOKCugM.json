If you have the time, I would recommend that you look at the books in the display cases in this room as I noticed quite a few tourists come in, take photos of the room, and leave. At the very least, take a look at the book on the right as you enter - it is one of the three Gutenburg bibles owned by the Morgan Library. The Study and the Librarian’s Office are also opulent, but not on par with the Historic Library. The office displayed a small exhibition of cylinder seals from the Middle-east as well as medieval jewelry from Europe. The room was once the domain of Belle da Costa Greene, JP Morgan’s private librarian. You may want to learn more about her on the Morgan Library website as her story is pretty fascinating. There are also numerous galleries that host rotating exhibits - the one on the second floor is called “Medieval Money, Merchants, and Morality” - a small, but fascinating look at the Medieval view of money and morality through the lens of books and paintings from that era. In the atrium, there is also a café that was bustling with visitors by lunch time - I think the food is on the expensive side, but the wine list is surprisingly good for a museum café.\n\nThe museum costs $22 for adults and entry is timed. Online tickets cost $25.50 for adults because it includes a ticketing fee. The fee is about the same as most NYC museums of similar size. Nonetheless, if you want to enter for free, you can stop by on Tuesdays or Sundays from 3 PM - 5 PM - reservations are not required. You can also enter for free from 5 PM - 7 PM on Fridays, but reservations are required via their website.\n\nLastly, if you want to take photos of the historic library without other people, get an online ticket for 10:30 AM, arrive by 10:15 AM, stand in line, and walk to the historic library as soon as the doors open. A lot of people will purchase tickets at the door and will begin with the first floor galleries, the office, or the study.
