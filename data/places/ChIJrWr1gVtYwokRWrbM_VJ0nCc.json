The guy who made the juice menu was an professional in the field and put together some awesome, nutritious drinks!\n\nBut then they fired everyone. The friendly staff that was super helpful disappeared, and they forced 1 cashier to run between the cafe, the juice bar, and eventually the grocery check out counter too. 3 jobs for 1 person.\n\nThey also did not set up their store to be disabled-friendly. I saw a person who used a wheelchair have to ask the staff to shop for them because half of the store was made inaccessible due to an unnecessary set of decorative stairs. They now have a wheelchair ramp, but if they had just been more conscious and customer oriented to start, they could have just set up the place correctly to begin with.\n\nAt one point when I was here, a different store owner in the area came into the store and cussed out the manager for how poorly run this place is. That happened way before it went further downhill.\n\nFurthermore, the ramen place at the back of the store used to be awesome when it was run by Japanese people who established the menu and really cared about the quality of the food. The ramen was great, and rivaled a lot of other ramen in the area. But then, suddenly and unceremoniously, those Japanese dudes were replaced by latino dudes, and the food just wasn't the same quality or flavor. I even asked the staff what happened to the Japanese dudes, and they said the Japanese dudes still worked there - just on different days..... However, I was a regular at that time and never saw the Japanese guys again.\n\nI believe this place has a habit of hiring good, caring people to establish legit menus and good food, good rapport and build a good reputation for about 3 months, and then they get rid of those people and hire their own staff to steal their menus and just try and run it themselves to profit for cheap.\n\nAlso, staff turnover is frequent - a red flag. When you have a place you go to like every day, it's kind of nice to feel like you're building a relationship with the folks you meet and who become part of your every day life, and you become part of theirs.\n\nWhen this place first opened, the staff was so friendly! Three folks I remember well - an older gentleman who was very kind and sweet (he gave me a candy cane on Christmas!), a younger woman who was energetic and eager to help anyone who looked like they needed help, and a young soft spoken man who was diligent and hard-working. They were there for quite a while, but after they disappeared, it was like the staff changed every few weeks. And as you might notice from other reviews, the customer service is not what it used to be.\n\nThis place is such a missed opportunity. It's in a great location with lots of potential. But management seems determined to provide only the bottom of the barrel service, scraping by with a new, attractive store design and good location surrounded by new residential buildings full of customers who don't have a lot of other choice in the area.\n\nI now only go here if I absolutely have to, and avoid it whenever possible. Even though I live on this block, I prefer to go across the street to the Deli on the South West corner, just because the service and everything else is more reliable and trustworthy.

The older woman at the cashier today at 3pm asked me if i wanted a bag. I said yes. She then proceeds to give me my order without a bag. I asked her nicely again for a bag. She replied with a disgusting attitude “I already asked if you wanted a bag.” And I replied “Which I said yes to” and she then proceeds to stop what she’s doing and grill me with the dirtiest look on her face. For someone who spends hundreds of dollars here this is not the common courtesy an employee should give a recurring customer. This is the second time this has happened over someone not listening at the cash register. I tried calling the place to speak to a manager but to no avail that their phone number doesn’t work. This isn’t acceptable and I would love for someone who works there of higher authority to contact me or make it possible for me to contact them. There is no reason for someone to be so nasty to someone who was treating them with pure respect.

The older woman at the cashier today at 3pm asked me if i wanted a bag. I said yes. She then proceeds to give me my order without a bag. I asked her nicely again for a bag. She replied with a disgusting attitude “I already asked if you wanted a bag.” And I replied “Which I said yes to” and she then proceeds to stop what she’s doing and grill me with the dirtiest look on her face. For someone who spends hundreds of dollars here this is not the common courtesy an employee should give a recurring customer. This is the second time this has happened over someone not listening at the cash register. I tried calling the place to speak to a manager but to no avail that their phone number doesn’t work.
