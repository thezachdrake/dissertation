Kornel and I developed a rapport over the years. He was a pleasant man and I always felt very comfortable with him. I met him in May 2014. He helped me when I had an infection in my spine after a surgery with another doctor. I had already had a laminectomy/discectomy of L5 – S1 by the previous doctor which resulted in a infection that needed to be treated immediately. The previous doctor did not treat me immediately and Dr. Kornel came on and treated the infection and had to perform a new operation opening up the site again and redoing the laminectomy/discectomy at L5 – S1.\nEverything was great until about sometime in 2017 when I began to experience some light spasms. Dr. Kornel sent me for shots, physical therapy and medication. These treatment therapies helped me for a little over a year and kept me out of surgery. However, in 2018 I would need another surgery. At this point I would need another laminectomy/discectomy; this time at L3 – L4.\nAfter the surgery, I would be in decent shape for a little while. I would go to Physical Therapy and continue with cortisone shot treatment. However, eventually I would need more surgery.\nIn November 2019, Dr. Kornel brought me in to the hospital through the emergency room in order to get into the hospital and bypass the wait times for the insurance because I was in so much pain; I could hardly walk at the time and would never had made the Aetna 14 day wait period. At this point he would do replacement disc surgery. He was going in to replace L5 - S1 and the three discs above that. However, the MRI showed that L5 – S1 was naturally fused. Unfortunately, Dr. Kornel would not replace this disc during this surgery.\nI continued to be in pain and in 2020 after MRIs and a battery of CAT scans, between Dr. Kornel and his associate, they found that L5 – S1 was not in fact naturally fused!\nI would need another surgery which would entail removing part of the cage that was built around my replacement titanium discs and then putting in L5 – S1 and then rebuilding the cage around the several discs.\nMy journey with Dr. Kornel started in 2014 and ended in approximately 2022- 8 years and 5 surgeries! BTW, I never mentioned that Dr Kornel had never gotten a chance to work on my cervical spine because he said he wanted my lower back to be in optimal shape before he ever addressed my neck. At that time I moved to Florida. Previous to that, I continued to be in serious pain and had new MRIs done and both Dr. Kornel and his associate looked over them again.\nI was given a diagnosis of failed back surgery syndrome. Dr. Kornel recommended that I might put in a spinal stimulator in the future. His associate thought that I might need surgery on my sacroiliac joint. There was definitely some disagreement on that fact. Either way, there was no solution, satisfaction or decent pain relief after an 8 year journey with Dr. Kornel and his practice. To top it off, on my disability paperwork for my New York State retirement, Dr. Kornel said that I was not permanently disabled from work due to the fact that there were \"possible treatment options that might make me better\"!!!\nHe kept telling me over the years that he would put me out for disability but I was too young. I left him when I was 54 years old and he still did not feel that the amount of chronic pain, the diagnosis of failed back surgery syndrome, and my pleas with him to help me because of my pain were are enough for him to write a detailed, true analysis of the previous eight years and a true analysis of my future rather than his God complex convoluted ideas!\nThink again before using this practice with Dr. Kornel!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"9 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"First off, I would like to say that dr.
