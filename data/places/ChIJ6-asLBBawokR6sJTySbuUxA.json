This review is long overdue — almost 2 years ago, we received the most unfortunate news a fur mom/dad could get, that our Charlie Brown could not be cured and his poor prognosis would deem him medically considerable for euthanasia. BPV was our regular vet (we used to live in the area), and upon receiving that news from an emergency vet, we brought our 15 year old Yorkie here to our trusty PCV (primary care vet), Dr. McLaughlin. It isn’t that we found a medical professional who didn’t recommend euthanasia, in fact, it was probably the best choice. But it was the fact they treated our urgency and desperation to keep Charlie Brown with us with sensitivity, professionalism, and providing us all of the possible medical options available in order for us to make the best possible decision for our dog. The entire staff supported our decision and we worked closely with them for an entire year with holistic and palliative care so that we could hear Charlie bark at things, run around, and of course, pee on our floor when we didn’t give him pizza. I know that I would not receive this level of care anywhere else. Needless to say, it is because of Dr. McLaughlin, Dr. Berk, and the entire staff that Charlie Brown lived a happy and fulfilling year after his initial recommendation for euthanasia. Eventually, when the time did come, our predicament was handled with generosity, tenderness, and with the utmost sincerity. I don’t know how else to give back to this place, but I hope a good review will encourage everyone to trust your fur babies here. Unfortunately for us, we did move a bit too far away to consider BPV our primary care vet, but I hope other people will. Thank you so much again everyone @ BPV for being our loving vet.
