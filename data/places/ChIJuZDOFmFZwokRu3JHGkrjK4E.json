I added an extra star for this.\n\nI'm truly disappointed to be leaving a one-star review for Shade Store. Fewer than 3% of reviews I’ve written are one-star, as I typically reserve this rating for experiences so problematic that no informed individual would willingly choose their services if an alternative was available. Regrettably, I believe my experience with Shade Store falls into this unfortunate category based on my recent interactions with them.\n\nWhat stands out about Shade Store is not rude or antagonistic staff, as you might often see in one-star reviews. On the contrary, the staff members I encountered were polite and professional. However, the overarching issue I faced was a pervasive sense of apathy within the company's culture. It felt as though, when things went wrong, I was left solely responsible for coordinating the necessary corrective actions, even when the errors were entirely Shade Store's responsibility.\n\nHere's a brief summary of my experience:\n\nMy wife and I visited the 77th and 3rd Ave location in Manhattan on June 22nd to select shades. A Shade Store technician measured our windows and service elevator on June 28th. On June 29th, I placed an order for three shades, costing over $5600. We had made it explicitly clear to our sales representative that we were expecting a newborn in approximately 5 weeks and hoped to have the shades installed before her birth. We were assured this was possible. However, our sales representative failed to notify us when our shades were ready to ship, preventing this from happening. She apparently had not received an email on her end to remind her about our order and without that we were forgotten.\n\nWhen I reached out to get a status update I learned that our shades were indeed ready to ship and had been for five days prior my inquiry. The delivery on July 24th was a disaster, as the Shade Store technician had incorrectly measured the dimensions of my service elevator. Additionally, the delivery personnel refused to use the stairs. This mistake led to the delivery being rejected, and I had no choice but to send the shades back, adding significant delay to the process.\n\nThe installation was scheduled for August 3rd, but I needed to schedule the shade delivery in the morning to ensure it arrived before the installation window. The installation technicians arrived late, at 4:15 pm, after the promised window had closed. I had to plead with my building's manager to allow them to work beyond my building’s cutoff of 4:30 pm, which he allowed given that I had a newborn at home.\n\nAfter installation, I discovered that the gaps on the sides of our bedroom shades were significantly larger than what was promised by Shade Store. The original measurements were all incorrect, and I was left to uncover these discrepancies myself.\n\nI contacted the Shade Store manager, who promised to remeasure the windows and expedite the remake of the shades. However, there was no real expedited process, and the installation was scheduled for September 29th, over three months after our initial visit. Correcting errors does not take priority over taking new orders for the Shade Store.\n\nThe manager had promised me that for the second delivery the shades would be brought all the way upstairs to avoid any inconvenience to me, yet once again the delivery personnel refused to bring the shades upstairs despite prior arrangements made with Shade Store (apparently these delivery personnel were subcontractors from another company that wouldn’t abide by the agreement). Additionally, half of the gaps were still incorrect, and at that point, I lost faith in Shade Store's manufacturing accuracy.\n\nI had hoped that Shade Store would handle the logistics for me, but they let me down at every turn. The multiple errors in measurement, manufacturing, and their failure to understand their own delivery company's policies, coupled with unfulfilled promises, make it clear that I cannot trust Shade Store with my future window covering needs."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"Update: Shade store did work with me to achieve a resolution I felt was fair.
