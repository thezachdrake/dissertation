While we work in class, she tells us funny stories and keeps us laughing. I really enjoy coming to see her each week.\nAlso, fyi this is a very expensive course. It is totally worth it though. Aside from tuition, be prepared to spend money on portfolios (3 for $150 each), notions, a dress form, and fabrics.\nSo I hope this review was helpful.
