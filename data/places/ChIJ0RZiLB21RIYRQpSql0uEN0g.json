After months of undiagnosed pain, one phone call with Meg changed everything.\n\nI had always believed in integrative health / functional health but had yet to work with a practitioner. Like most people, I took my body for granted until it was too late and my body started to not be able to fight back on its own. I was hitting dead ends with more “conventional” western doctors, and so taking a different approach and looking holistically made sense for me.\n\nMany tests later, I found out a had a biotoxin (mold) illness, some genetic markers that showed I was more susceptible to mold than others, a very weak immune system, among other things. Meg helped me with a personalized supplement protocol, a strict anti-inflammatory diet, and a suggested exercise routine. We checked in semi-regularly as I embarked on my detoxing journey. With time and patience, a lot of my daily symptoms at the time started to subside (and went from chronic to intermittent) because of the work we did together.\n\nMeg is compassionate and since she personally went through some similar pain years prior, it felt like she genuinely cared for my wellbeing. Meg was the anchor to my health care support team that I started to build around me. I sought help from an acupuncturist, a chiropractor, a therapist, a personal trainer etc. I realized how connected everything was and that it was a group effort. It was an overwhelming time for me since this was just the beginning of my non-linear healing journey. But Meg really showed up for me, even beyond her expected job description. When it was time for me and my wife to finally bite the bullet and move out of our water-damaged apartment, Meg introduced us to a mold consultant PJ Harlow Wellness, who shed light on how to do it correctly. (Basically, no remodeled homes and leave all your stuff behind). It was a really tough time and Meg helped uncover things that made me get more in touch with my body and my mind. Meg is kind and very knowledgeable; if she doesn’t know something, she has an experienced group of people to rely on for help.\n\nMeg’s goal is to make herself obsolete and empower her patients to feel like they’re in control of their fates. She shared resources with me over the many months of working together and eventually it felt like I had “graduated” into a new stage, and maybe needed to work with someone else to uncover things that were beyond what we were working on. She referred me to the CLEAR Center of Health in Mill Valley, which is where I started working with Dr. Tenney, who helped me figure out that I had a prolactinoma (a small tumor secreting excess prolactin hormone) on my pituitary gland. Had it not been for Meg referring me to them, who knows how long I would have been living with this tumor.\n\nMeg and I have remained friendly since, and I’ve referred her to other friends and strangers who’ve been exposed to mold and/or who are looking for an experienced and determined functional practitioners.\n\nMeg’s personal healing journey always gave me hope that one day I would fully heal, even though I know it could take years and every body is different. Those types of inspiring stories go a long way, and while there have been many hard times, I’ve been able to stay committed over the last few years as I keep working on myself and treating various ailments that have been found along the way.\n\nInvisible chronic pain that is often misunderstood by your average person is hard to cope with for sure…but working with Meg made the weeks feels less scary and the treatment feel doable. I know that Meg has only gained more knowledge since I worked with her in 2021 and she has definitely broadened her expertise in order to help more people (like meditative practices). She’s a gem of a person and a recent phone call made me wonder if I should even reschedule some one-off check-ins with her.
