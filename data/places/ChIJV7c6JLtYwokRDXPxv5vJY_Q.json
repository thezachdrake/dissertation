owner of Armato Ice, truly brought back my belief that white glove service, top notch professionalism and overall desire to help a customer solve a challenge by going well above and beyond, still

drive in the summer.  He never dropped the ball, was extremely responsive and provided details of the type and amount of dry ice I needed to solve my challenge.\n\nTEAMWORK - Anthony worked with me to figure out what I needed, how I needed to pack the frozen food in the coolers to ensure optimal (longest lasting) benefit of the dry ice.  We coordinated his routine of being at his uptown warehouse, with my need to leave the city early, for an early morning pick-up.\n\nDEPENDABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY - I can't say enough.  In this day and age of ghosting, cutting corners, overpromising, surprise charges or purchases that fall short of expectations, Anthony was adamant about not overpromising what he could delivery during a pandemic, post-hurricane, and more.  He underpromised and overdelivered.  It was an amazing customer experience.\n\nPRODUCT AND SERVICE - Anthony and team were waiting for me uptown, and  packed my coolers with dry ice and proceeded to wrap them tightly closed with plastic wrap so the ice would last longer.  He and his team were kind, professional and fun during what could have been a small transaction.\n\nRESULTS - After a 5 day cross-country drive (Labor Day weekend - which means it was hot), my food arrived still frozen and in great condition.

My purchase was small and I was treated as though I was a long-standing important/large customer.  Anthony is about building relationships with all who cross his path, which will pay off in spades.
