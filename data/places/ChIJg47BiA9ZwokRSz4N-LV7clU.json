Of great importance, not all acupuncture are created equal: I had tried acupuncture before, and it did nothing for me. Also, Dr. Moroz has a wonderful team working with him, including highly skilled interns, and I must also mention his assistant, Yvonne: she is a positively encouraging influence at the practice. I can't resist, I must mention someone else: his secretary, Roxanne. She registers as highly efficient but not an automaton. Whenever I talk to Roxanne, I know things will be taken care of.
