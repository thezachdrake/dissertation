Upon entering this small but cozy packed establishment, we were greeted by the manager, Antonio and was promptly seated at our table for 4 with the tiled floors, wood work and festive Christmas decorations making one feel you’re in mood for the holidays. The well labeled menu featured many different options of Sicilian cuisine (house-made fresh pastas, grilled and roasted seafood, poultry and veal) with special dishes of the day. For starters, we opted to share the Caprese (Buffalo mozzarella cheese from Salerno, Italy.) As our main meal, we decided on Pappardelle alla Bolognese, Pollo alla Parmigiana and Calamari Fritti. To celebrate our dear Floridian guests, we toasted with an espresso martini, glass Prosecco and sparking waters their visit. Complimentary bread and bread sticks started our meal. Every dish is quite simply amazing and has that fresh home made from scratch authentic Italian food taste enough to make one full and content. Unfortunately we didn’t have any room for desserts. The staff were so attentive and friendly including our server Luis, and we were made to feel welcome from the moment we walked through the door.
