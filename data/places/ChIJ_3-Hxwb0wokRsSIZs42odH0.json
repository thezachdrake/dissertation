First of all Zendaya is awesome and runs such a clean and beautiful establishment.  She is so down to earth and has extensive experience which made me feel at ease for my first time whitening my teeth. My teeth were not badly stained to begin with but I just wanted that extra shine for my birthday this week. I did the 1 hour session; she has comfortable reclining chairs, ports to charge your phone and also plays movies/TVs to watch while you are getting beautified :) By the end of my session my teeth were literally glowing, I was happily surprised by the results! She also sends you an email with explicit instructions on how to care for your new pearly whites. So inspiring to see another Latina thrive and run such an awesome establishment. I've already recommend friends to visit as I've been receiving compliments on my smile :) Loved it!"},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"6 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"This place easily deserves each 5 star review and nothing less.

Zeneyda assured me of everything and the process was smooth. I have never had customer service like this before. I loved hearing her stories and her personality and aura was beautiful. Rare to find people like her these days especially when all people want is money and don’t care about the customers. My results were amazing I fell in love with my teeth all over again. Thanks to her I can smile and feel confident. I will definitely be coming back for another round before I leave and every-time I come back from overseas.
