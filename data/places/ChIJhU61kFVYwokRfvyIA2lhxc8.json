Then I asked about the summit. I sent an email in Japanese, but since there was no reply, I also sent an email in English. But still, it was no good. When I couldn't get emails or get tickets in advance, I thought I might have been scammed.\n*Explanations other than the summit are detailed. But for the summit, I haven't. The Japanese website is not written perfectly. I ask for improvement.\n\n2: The Japanese notation on the website is strange.\nThis company's website states that you need to come to the office to get a ticket. However, when you actually went there, why did you come all the way to the company? They said. As you can see, there is a difference between the HP and the actual response, which resulted in a huge loss of time.\n\nFor these reasons, I gave this rating.
