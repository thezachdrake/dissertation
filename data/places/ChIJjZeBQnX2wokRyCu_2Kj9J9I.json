I am highly allergic to latex and have now been experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction days later. I was not asked if i had any allergies, nor was i asked if it was okay to use a CONDOM as a \"sterile\" tool for gynecological exams. I do not believe this is best practice nor is it something i would be okay with. I would have declined the test if i knew this was their standard procedure. I have had many ultrasounds due to the nature of my issue and this has NEVER happened before.

I have been trying (and failing) to reach a secretary or any sort of representative on the line. I keep leaving messages and no one is responding to me.

You need to have open and honest conversations with women before doing something as invasive as that. it was a really horrible experience for me.  I, unfortunately, will not be returning to this practice.
