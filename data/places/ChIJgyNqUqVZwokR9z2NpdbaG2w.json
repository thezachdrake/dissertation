Sturdy enough to hold all the ingredients and didn’t taste chalky like I’ve come across before. The carne asada was out fo this world, so tender and full of flavor! We also got a side of the elotes and wooooowwww I’m still thinking about how good it is. Finished the meal with a bowl of mango with lime and tajin, which was perfectly balanced and (I can’t stress this enough) the freshest mango I’ve ever had.
