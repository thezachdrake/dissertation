At the end of the haircut I was asked when my previous haircut was, a question that should be asked at the beginning of a cut. When I responded 2-3 weeks, the barber responded \"oh I'm surprised because that was a lot of length taken off\". He also mentioned that for Asians, they should either keep the sides very short or grow their hair out so it felt to me that he already had a gameplan without really paying attention to what I wanted. I'm not the type to write negative reviews, especially for small businesses, but it really has sucked looking at the mirror these past few weeks.
