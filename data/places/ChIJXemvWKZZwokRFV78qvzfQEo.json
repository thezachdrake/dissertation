But then they joined three attendants and started to question me about the trip (procedure that I considered normal at first) but then they started to be ironic with me, with questions such as (who paid for your trip, what is your itinerary, why did you issue a visa to Jordan, your bosses give you vacation days, which countries you have been to, why do you know Israel at that moment, you left the airport in the interval between one flight and another, why do you have two cell phones… the three went to talk in a corner and went back and continued the interrogation (who do you live with, where do your parents live, what do you work with… everything was answered in a calm way and they kept mocking me, laughing at my face at times).  After about 45 minutes of interrogation in front of everyone in the check-in hall, they said they were going to collect my checked luggage and my backpack and they would search.  They sent me to check-in, I went through all the normal airport security procedures and when I was in front of the boarding gate, they took me to an El Al room and there began more abuse, and started to collect all my belongings such as: wallet, bank cards, watch, neck chain, sneakers, and they started to inspect my backpack and my suitcase without my permission to accompany them.  I was waiting in an anteroom.  They took headphones out of the case and told me that everything that was in my backpack would go in the suitcase (cell phone, tablet, medicine, keys to my house, anything you can imagine) then they took me to a room and started to to search myself, feeling all over my body from hair to toe, and I still had to pull down my pants and stay only in my underwear.  Total embarrassment.  This took over an hour and even confirming that I am a tourist on vacation, with nothing prohibited along, they put me through another interrogation until the moment I asked to return to Brazil after all these human rights violations.  I was treated ironically and disrespectfully at all times.  Only the translator Tania treated me like a human.
