We ordered the truffle fries and we barely left any on the bowl because they were so good. We both ordered the classic lobster roll but I ordered mine with bacon. It was very good! It was exciting when the boat set sail and started sailing around. One funny thing happened my friend and I felt the strong breeze from where we were sitting that the wind blew away some of food on the floor. Our waiter said it happens all the time. I’ll bet. Lol! Before our trip was over our waiter told us the boat has another trip that sails at 7pm and it sails straight to the Statue of Liberty. He said the trip is very beautiful during sunset.
