I have always been honest with my doctors, especially a psychiatrist but with this guy, that was a YUGE mistake. He asked me if I had ever smoked weed and I said yes, ocassionally. After typing who knows what info his computer and not paying any attention to me whatsoever, he recommended that I go to rehab or pothead's anonymous. He said he wouldn't be taking me in until I cleaned up. I don't even know how to roll! When friends smoke, I may join but it's not something that I need or would even go buy. Not that there's anything wrong with smoking but I'm just not that into it. I tried to explain that to him but his hick, arrogant ass acted as if I wasn't even there after telling me that he wouldn't take me in. I really needed someone because I was very depressed and this guy just made me feel 100 times worse. I thought maybe it was me but from seeing the other reviews, I see that he's the problem.
