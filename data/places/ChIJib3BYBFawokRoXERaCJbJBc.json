They transferred me to a loan company that said they would not absorb that into my current loan.  Then I called my creditor to try and negotiate myself since Gitmeid said they won't attempt to even start the negotiations until August!!  That's another 6 months and I've been waiting 8 months already.  My creditor apparently got tired of waiting and charged off the account which is an even WORSE scenario than what I was in before.  Now I owe more than the original debt and my credit is in the toilet because a charged off account impacts your score extremely negatively.  Now I have to wait for the collections agency this creditor turned my account over to, to send a letter.  I would continue to tell people to stay away.

The program was to last about 3 years. After about a year, they tried to offer transferring the program to someone else that would pay off the loan while they still worked to settle my debts but instead of paying for 2 more years the offer would be about the same amount of money each month for another 5 years. I obviously did not accept that because it was a horrible offer. I don’t know if it was because I didn’t accept that or they really just couldn’t negotiate offers as good for me as the first settlements but no other settlement offer was as good after that. I ended up settling an offer on our own and removing a debt. I believe I paid the original amount of money that it was supposed to be with all the debts on there and I ended up getting $50 refunded to me even though two were removed. We also used our entire tax refund check to try to end the program early so we could have money each month to pay for a second vehicle for our 6 person family.  It took about 6 months and several phone calls from that time for everything to finally be resolved and get that refund. It felt like they were dragging their feet on it and  that they settled the last debt just enough to use up all the money. The last phone call I had, I was told I could expect over $70 back if settled within a certain amount of time but it was only $50.\nI would say nearly everyone I spoke to was friendly though. The program did allow me to pay off those debts instead of spending years trying to pay it off with interest but our credit is terrible because of it and we are paying higher interest rates on our vehicles. Had the program continued the way it began I would recommend it but considering how everything ended up we aren’t exactly pleased."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"4 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I was really happy with the first round of debt they settled.
