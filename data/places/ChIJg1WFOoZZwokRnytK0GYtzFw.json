We had experience with neonatal kittens and decided to take him in and foster. By 4 weeks we began noticing digestive issues, at first is was constipation, and no interest in weaning onto wet food, then it became daily vomiting, unable to gain weight, and a patchy dull coat. We went to multiple emergency vets and our regular vet all of whom did not give us a diagnosis, and even went as far as to say that we would have to put him down if he didn't start tolerating solid food (this was when he was 6 weeks old). We finally found Dr. Haroush, I went to his office in tears asking him if he thought there was anything that we could do to save our sweet kittens life. He calmed me down, told me that Monty was not a lost cause and that we could approach his illness as aggressively or slowly as we would like. He ran multiple tests, and found a high bacteria count, and addessed it with medications and told us we could continue bottle feeding him as long as he needed it (up to 10 weeks) which was the opposite of what we had heard from other vets). It took about 3 months from the time we started seeing Dr. Haroush for Monty to finally get better, and each time we went to see Dr. Haroush he customized Monty's treatment based on how well he was doing on certain medications and what food he was starting to tolerate. While he may not be the most cost effective vet option in the city, he was the most proactive and we now have an incredibly healthy and strong 6 month old kitten who I believe would not be alive if it weren't for the team at Animal Health Center."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"My Fiance and I found a 2 week old abandons stray kitten back in July.
