I looked around for 4 years with no success. Every shop that i went to made a bunch of promises and then never called me back or even worse in some cases stopped taking my calls.  I couldn't understand why this kept happening. I tried in 4 of the 5 boroughs in New York and each time without fail, no one would touch it. Then I remembered that I had met Stefano 10 years prior when i was looking to upgrade my Audi A8L factory system. So i called Stef at his new location for Auto Design Nyc on West 46th street and made arrangements to stop by. As soon as i got there, I noticed the Roles Royce in the driveway that his guys were working on. He took the time to explain that the fiber optics in the car make it a job that only a professional would even think about tackling.  At this point, i was discouraged because no other shop would even make the attempt. He quickly assured me that this job was no big deal to him, but would take a little time (a few days) to execute properly. He sat with me for about an hour and helped me explore my options after taking jabs at me for not coming to him sooner of course (which i knew he would and rightfully so - you want a professional job - go to a professional lol). I dropped my car off on Monday (the week of Thanksgiving ). Stefano let me know that he would be done in a couple of days and that he'd call me when it was done. He called me on Wednesday just let me know that he was pretty much done and that i could come by Friday morning and pick it up (Thursday was Thanksgiving ). When i showed up on Friday around 12pm, there was an orange and black Lamborghini in the driveway. The owner of the Lamborghini was telling me that they had been testing the system in my car before i arrived and that my car sounded great. He had bro2ught his car to Auto Design Nyc because another shop was unable to properly do the work necessary and recommended Stefano (which is the biggest compliment another business can ever give you - to admit that they are unable to do the work that they are incorporated to do and pass you off to a better shop). By the look on Stefano's face, i knew my car sounded great before he even turned it on. And as soon as i greeted him, he went straight for my car and turned on my new system. The difference in audio quality sound is unbelievable! !!!!. Before this i was going to get rid of it and get the Porsche Panamera - now, after hearing it- I'll just keep it and get the Panamera as well. Stefano even had my car detailed and had some scratches buffed out of my car as well while the whole shop enjoyed the music coming from my car so clearly.  Now I'm definitely going back to get more work done and fully customize my 750.  It really makes no sense to go anywhere else to get this or any other kind of custom work done to your vehicle.  I'm 100% satisfied with the work that was done and my choice to use Auto Design Nyc to complete it. If you want a professional job and transparency with regards to costs and options, Go To Auto Design Nyc.
