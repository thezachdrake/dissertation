I'm a senior now so there are times that I might not feel well or be unable to attend physically. They are live stream on Sundays so people all around the country are able to attend services and become a part of the wonderful praise and worship that goes on at St Luke's Baptist Church. This video was taken on the day that the church celebrated its original pastor JG McCann passed away a couple of years ago.
