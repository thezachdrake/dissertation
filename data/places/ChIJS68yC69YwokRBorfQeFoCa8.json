This garage is a scam. We reserved a parking space using the ParkWhiz app. That app requires you to specify a timeframe for parking, and on this particular trip we made good time to the city and arrived 45 minutes earlier than planned. When we entered the garage the manager told us we would have to pay more since we arrived prior to our reservation - which on its own was annoying but we didn’t argue - and would have to pay an additional $13, which is the hourly parking fee. We thought it strange that they would not accept payment for the hour right when we arrived, instead saying that we should settle up when we left, but left the car anyway. When we came to collect the car, earlier than planned, we were surprised to be charged an additional $60 versus the $13 we were told about. The attendant at the garage said this is “the same thing that always happens with the app people” and after arguing for 10 minutes we insisted to speak with the manager. The manager claimed to have a perfect memory, as he has with all of his customers every time this happens, and claimed to have told us that our “discounted app rate” was invalidated when we arrived early and that we were charged the more expensive drive-in daily rate that resulted in the additional $60 charge. Had this been communicated upon arrival we would have left, but it explained why the manager did not allow us to pay the $13 difference when we arrived. This experience and the assertions that “the same thing always happens with the app people” is proof positive that this is a scam. Imagine how much this garage makes from fleecing people like this.
