Eastside has a fabulous showroom with many of their samples built into their floor that also houses a pool table and baby grand piano. It’s a huge space that provides so many types of flooring that we were grateful that we made an appointment so we could benefit from the expertise of our salesperson, Matt.  Whether you are looking for flooring for your beach house or bedroom, we were impressed by their selection as well as how reasonable their prices were. You might be thinking that you could go to one of those huge home improvement stores and maybe you could get flooring for less, but why risk your investment, when you could buy from one of the best flooring businesses! Here’s my thinking: Eastside Floors only sells flooring products! They don’t sell carpets, tiles or plastic flooring. And they’ve been in business for over twenty years.
