Both are vibrant with a tasty rim.\n\nFood: the food here is good, there are definitely some standouts, but I wouldn’t necessarily say the best part of the experience. The potstickers, spicy tuna crispy rice, and Japanese yakimishi fried rice are amazing. The fried rice has a great bit of crunch from the bacon and is a healthy portion size. Potstickers come in a delicious sauce and are incredibly juicy. The rock shrimp tempura was disappointing for a seafood fan. The breading overpowers the shrimp and leaves you feeling like you could find it in a frozen bag. The cauliflower was similarly breaded but the fry and flavor were much better. The eggrolls are good but a small portion for the price. Brussels sprouts are great, pretty standard. There are some great dishes and some misses, but overall the pricing is a little steep for what you’re getting.\n\nAmbiance: the ambiance here is so so good. The music is great, the lighting is perfect, and the decor is magical. It’s sexy and sleek, perfect for a date or a group of friends on a night out.\n\nService: Amazing service all around. Bartenders (Jerome and others… unsure of their names) are all super friendly and helpful.
