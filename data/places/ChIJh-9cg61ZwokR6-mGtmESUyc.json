As a first-time home buyer, I had several questions during each stage of the process. Beginning with our initial phone conversation, Nicole ushered me through the home-buying journey with ease.\n\nWorking with Nicole was as painless as can be. She is highly responsive, which is something I expected coming from a fast-paced industry. She is available at all hours of the day by phone and text, which is critical in a market that moves quickly. Nicole is also very good with technology - something I can especially appreciate as a younger home buyer.\n\nWhat I valued most about Nicole is that she kept me honest and was never pushy. For example, after I added a few listings to my target list that fell outside my desired geography, she challenged me to think about whether I wanted to spend time there. Relatedly, Nicole never pushed me to look at homes that were outside my price range.\n\nNicole has an entire support team behind her, including a board package expert and assistant who were both fantastic. But to be clear - Nicole was highly involved every step of the way.\n\nNicole was also an effective liaison between me, the sellers, sellers’ agent, attorneys, and other third parties. She prioritized my concerns and fought for me as a buyer. Most notably, she was able to negotiate an attractive price for me (below ask, which is rare in this market). She successfully fought to incorporate additional seller concessions into the contract which I hadn’t considered, including repair work to the unit prior to my ownership. It was during the negotiating stage where Nicole’s experience really shined through.\n\nNicole has several connections in the broader industry who were crucial to a smooth process. She recommended an attorney and a lender who I ultimately decided to partner with. It was her lending relationship that offered me the most attractive rate. Nicole even gave me recommendations for painters and movers, which was beyond the scope of her role.\n\nLastly, on a personal level, Nicole is down-to-earth, energetic, and fun to work with. She has a unique gift in that she can connect with people of all different backgrounds. I look forward to working with Nicole and her team again when it comes time for my next home purchase."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I would highly recommend Nicole and her team.
