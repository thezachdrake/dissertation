Horrible service.

Extremely hard to reach her and get things going, tells me to send pictures of myself and that she will forward color options from what she has. Then literally 6 days before the shower writes me “hey” then I ask her is this going to happen?? Because she has not yet shown me colors nor asked for a deposit.... After I went out to get measurements at that. Waste of time out of my life! Extremely upsetting! So if you’re going to ask for a custom dress I suggest months before since she clearly doesn’t have a efficient functioning system to take in many orders nor knows how to handle the request properly when it’s done at a time she cannot handle.
