Her expertise and passion for teaching were evident throughout the course.\nI gained valuable insights into facial anatomy, learned about the science of botulinum toxin and dermal fillers, and even received guidance on managing complications. The hands-on practice allowed me to inject different areas with Botox and dermal fillers, including cheeks, chin, and lips. The small group setting ensured personalized attention, making me feel confident as I started injecting my first patients.\nAnita’s extensive experience as an injectable trainer truly shone through. Her expertise in the field, having taught various procedures to professionals across the country, was evident in her teaching style. The 24/7 access to course materials was a great resource for further learning.\nI highly recommend the BeautyFix Training Center to both beginners and experienced practitioners.
