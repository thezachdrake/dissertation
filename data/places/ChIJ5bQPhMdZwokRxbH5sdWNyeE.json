The scenery of the city is awesome. Lots of good areas to take pictures. There is a nice place to sit towards the end of the exit. Sorta like orchestra seating. I wish we were able to walk further up the line but it cuts off by 23rd street then you figure out your way from there on the streets.  One direction only. Some parts are narrower than others. Would like to have gone all the way up to the very end. They did not have any vendors on the line where you could buy drinks or food. Some random performers to entertain you was ok.
