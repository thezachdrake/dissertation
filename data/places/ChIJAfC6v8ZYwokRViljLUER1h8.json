Not only was I nervous because I never had surgery, but I was also pressed for time because I started back school in less than a month... Fast Forward, his  entire surgical team went over everything in detail (A LOT). I chose the option to be put to sleep, once I woke up, I did not experience any pain, they feed you, make sure you use the bathroom, keep you in the recovery area for about 2 hrs, then sends you home with a free pillow. Everyone from the assistants to the Nurses were extremely nice and caring. He prescribed me pain pills but I was shocked I didn't need to take them, Also the surgical site looked like a small cut, you wouldn't even notice it was cut open!!  My arm was in a splint for about a week and it looks like I'll be able to start back school with no issues. Very excited with my results, this whole process took about two weeks!!!
