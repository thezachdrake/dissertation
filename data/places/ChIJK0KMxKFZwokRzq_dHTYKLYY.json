However, I do think this should be addressed as it’s not professional nor should be accepted.\n\nI was lucky to have been squeezed into Dr. Joseph Tawil’s schedule the same day that I called after having seen my home doctor and deciding we should further do some testing to rule out all possible causes for the recurring dizziness I was having. In the examining office, he was very friendly and detailed in his explanations, which certainly reassured any worries I had about it possibly being related to problems with my heart. To be 100% sure, he had setup a screening to take images of my heart. Obviously I had to be topless for this procedure, but it was with another female technician and not the doctor himself. A few minutes into the screening, there’s a knock on the door, and it’s Dr. Tawil asking the tech about her schedule for the rest of the day. Initially, he didn’t come inside, just spoke through the door he opened slightly where even his foot wouldn’t have fit through without opening more. But eventually he just came right in and stood with the tech discussing what other patients were scheduled to come in. There is a door for a reason and although he is the cardiologist assigned to examining me, I felt it was completely out of bounds to interrupt the screening where I’m lying there with no shirt or bra on just to go over her schedule. It really could have waited. Then after he leaves, the other doctor, Dr. Berdoff also comes in and sticks his head in like we’re just in there taking lunch. I know they’re doctors and probably have a different outlook on the human body, but I felt this was a huge invasion of privacy. At the end of the day, they’re men and I’m a woman, and no matter how much they want to say they are professional, it’s not right that they just nonchalantly come and go as a woman is half-naked. Especially with Dr. Berdoff who had absolutely zero reason to come in at all. I did not feel safe nor comfortable."},"relativePublishTimeDescription":"5 years ago","text":{"languageCode":"en","text":"I am disappointed that I need to rate so low because everything else went well at the office.
