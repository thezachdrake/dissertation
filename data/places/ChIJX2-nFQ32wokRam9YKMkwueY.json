I walked to the line which wasn't crazy long and then decided to just run to shoe department to look. This individual followed me and said in a very nasty tone the store was closed gesturing with her hands. I ignored her at first cause I didn't know who the hell she was speaking to like that. After I just looked down the aisle I turned and said I heard you. She responds \"oh I didn't know if you spoke English cause you didn't answer me\" and quite frankly I didn't have to answer her. She made a statement, she didn't ask a question. Additionally there were several other customers still shopping on the floor but I was her target. I have never been treated like this coming in this store and as I said I come here often so it was not at all appreciated. Whether I speak English, Latin, Chinese or Spanish CUSTOMER SERVICE is crucially important. Tone is important, interaction is important, and knowing your place is important.
