You can sit at their computer and type in \"streptococcus,\" for example, and the computer map lights up with all the locations in which this bacteria was found---in a lovely hue indicating its prevalence in an area. Another computer does the same for NYC's street trees--select a tree name, and the map lights up in thousands of colored dots indicating where that tree is found--right down to borough and block!
