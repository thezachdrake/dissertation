Blaga and her amazing team helped to make our wedding amazing!!! To me, pictures and video are two of the most important aspects because most spend a good amount of time taking pictures on your wedding day and you and your family will be looking back at those pictures to remember your special day forever!  We have received countless compliments on our pictures and videos from our guests and social media friends.  My husband and I considered at least 4 or 5 other photographers before picking Lush Life Film.  The moment I called Blaga I felt that she really cares.  We met the next day and had no doubt that she and her team will be capturing our big day.  I absolutely loved how all pictures and video came out.  The best part is that Blaga and her team were so nice, down to earth, and made us feel so comfortable!  As a bride and groom, your are often pulled in so many directions on your big day between your guests and photographer you almost forget to breath, relax and enjoy yourselves.  Blaga and her team made our day so much easier and enjoyable.  They were SUPER ORGANIZED and knew exactly how much time we needed to spend taking pictures and how we wanted them, we had backup plans for different scenarios and it worked out perfectly!!  And, best of all... we got my pictures and video so FAST!! The level of PROFESSIONALISM Blaga and her team showed us was exceptional.  It keeps the fun of the wedding going on for longer when you have your pictures and video to enjoy!!
