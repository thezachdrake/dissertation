## Research Question

Do place type interactions predict crime hot spots, and if so,
at what spatial co-location threshold (Jaccard similarity)?

## Summary Statistics by Threshold

| Threshold | N Interactions | Converged | Mean R² | Best R² |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 0.6 | 66 | 12/12 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 0.65 | 62 | 12/12 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 0.75 | 39 | 12/12 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 0.85 | 2 | 12/12 | 0.001 | 0.0015 |
| 0.9 | 1 | 12/12 | 0.0009 | 0.0014 |

## Interpretation

**Key Findings:**

- As Jaccard threshold increases, fewer interaction pairs are selected
- Model convergence rates and predictive performance across thresholds
  indicate whether interaction effects are robust to operationalization

**Theoretical Implications:**

If interactions fail across all thresholds, this suggests that combined
routine activities at co-located place types do not modify crime risk
beyond individual place type effects. If a specific threshold shows strong
performance, this identifies the optimal spatial co-location scale for
detecting place interaction effects.
